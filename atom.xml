Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 6’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 6 and Launch the Application</strong></strong></p><p>At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 6 to the system using a working cable and trust the system. On the interface of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), just agree to its terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Enter the Details of the Target Location</strong></strong></p><p>Once your Apple iPhone 6 is detected by the interface, its present location would be displayed with other details. To spoof the location of your Apple iPhone 6 on Pokemon Go, you can click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Now, you can go to the search options on the top-left side and enter the address or exact coordinates of the Pokestop. You can find the location of a Pokestop from several freely available online sources.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone 6 Location to a Pokemon stop</strong></strong></p><p>As you would enter the location, the interface will automatically change to the designated spot. You can now move the pin around on the map and even zoom in&#x2F;out to drop it at the exact spot. In the end, just click on the “Move Here” button to spoof your Apple iPhone 6’s location and visit the Pokemon stop virtually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Besides that, you can also use the one-stop or multi-stop modes of the application to simulate your movement and visit the nearby Pokemon Go stops.</p><p>I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to know about Poke stops in Pokemon Go. I have included several tips that I implement to find Pokemon stops near me in this guide. Though, if you want to catch more Pokemons via Pokemon Go stops, then you can simply use Lure Modules. Apart from that, you can also use a dedicated location spoofer like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) to visit Pokemon stops anywhere in the world and replenish unlimited items without any trouble.</p><h2 id="Hacks-to-do-pokemon-go-trainer-battles-For-Apple-iPhone-6"><a href="#Hacks-to-do-pokemon-go-trainer-battles-For-Apple-iPhone-6" class="headerlink" title="Hacks to do pokemon go trainer battles For Apple iPhone 6"></a>Hacks to do pokemon go trainer battles For Apple iPhone 6</h2><p>With the launch of the Pokémon Go battle league, the trainer battles are seen as one of the options that can be used to compete and do it the hard way. As the name suggests it is a feature in Pokémon Go that lets you battle as a trainer against the other trainers. Pokémon Go trainer battles are a great way to enhance your skills as the rules are different from the gym and raid battles which are also a great feature of this game. The Pokémon CP limits are granted to each league from which the trainer needs to choose one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 1"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Point-of-Trainer-Battles-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Point-of-Trainer-Battles-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the Point of Trainer Battles in Pokémon Go?"></a>Part 1: What is the Point of Trainer Battles in Pokémon Go?</h2><p>The best part is that the teams are assembled by the trainers themselves. The point of the trainer battles is that a winning team is chosen while competing with the other players. The trainer battles Pokémon Go also lets the trainers choose the best players that would charge and power up Pokémon. Different spoils are embedded within the trainer battles and they all are worth trying. Once the trainer battles he is rewarded three times per day as a normal team leader. As an AI team leader, you can get the reward once every day.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 2"                ></p><p>Now you want to make sure that the charged attacks are learned and how they can be used as a weapon against the other players. The Pokémon should also be chosen as per the ability as different Pokémon have different charged attack ability overall. The Pokémon is of a different kind as all benefit from the charge attack in different states. It also means that you get to choose Pokémon like Tyranitar which will get you to through the battle with highly advanced skills. Typhlosion is a dual-type Pokémon and the raids which are done using it benefit the trainers as compared to single types.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-can-you-get-from-trainer-battles-Pokemon-go"><a href="#Part-2-What-can-you-get-from-trainer-battles-Pokemon-go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?"></a>Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?</h2><p>This part will deal with the rewards which the trainers will get for the battles which they will fight. There are three different types of rewards that you can win when it comes to trainer battles. These are as follows:</p><ul><li>Stardust</li><li>As of January 2019, the Rare Candy reward has also been introduced to make the battles more enchanting.</li><li>1 in 7 chance of Sinnoh Stone.</li></ul><p>No matter that you win or lose a battle these rewards are credited to your account. If you are playing with a computer the threshold to get the rewards is 1. If you are competing with the other players then the rewards can be earned thrice per day. Both the participants will get the same rewards but the abilities are different depending on the fact that whether you are a winner or loser. The Ace trainer medal and its acquaintance will also get the level up with each battle that you win. The other three medals will also get a level up as per a blog post from Niantic. These medals are as follows:</p><ul><li>Great League Veteran</li><li>Ultra League Veteran</li><li>Master League Veteran.</li></ul><p>The rematches that are done in the trainer battles also account for the leveling up in all the medals as well as the other rewards that are explained.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_3.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 3"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-CP-Matter-in-Trainer-Battles"><a href="#Part-3-Does-CP-Matter-in-Trainer-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Does CP Matter in Trainer Battles?"></a>Part 3: Does CP Matter in Trainer Battles?</h2><p>In Pokémon trainer battle it indeed matters and this is one of the basic phenomena that will take you and your team to the next level. The CP stands for combat power and it means the power of your Pokémon. As a trainer when you battle more and more the XP increases and the CP as well. This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pokémon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pokémon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pokémon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pokémon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pokémon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pokémon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you. Use candies and power up your Pokémon to a higher level. It will also ensure that you get the best results on the battlefield. The weight and the size of the Pokémon also affect the CP score so you need a Pokémon that is both agile and lightweight to get the best results.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Tips-to-level-up-Pokemon-before-doing-the-Pokemon-go-trainer-battles"><a href="#Part-4-Tips-to-level-up-Pokemon-before-doing-the-Pokemon-go-trainer-battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Tips to level up Pokémon before doing the Pokémon go trainer battles"></a>Part 4: Tips to level up Pokémon before doing the Pokémon go trainer battles</h2><p>To get the best out of Pokémon Go battle another trainer it is advised to get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and Launch the Application</strong></strong></p><p>At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to the system using a working cable and trust the system. On the interface of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), just agree to its terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Enter the Details of the Target Location</strong></strong></p><p>Once your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is detected by the interface, its present location would be displayed with other details. To spoof the location of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max on Pokemon Go, you can click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Now, you can go to the search options on the top-left side and enter the address or exact coordinates of the Pokestop. You can find the location of a Pokestop from several freely available online sources.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Location to a Pokemon stop</strong></strong></p><p>As you would enter the location, the interface will automatically change to the designated spot. You can now move the pin around on the map and even zoom in&#x2F;out to drop it at the exact spot. In the end, just click on the “Move Here” button to spoof your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max’s location and visit the Pokemon stop virtually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Besides that, you can also use the one-stop or multi-stop modes of the application to simulate your movement and visit the nearby Pokemon Go stops.</p><p>I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to know about Poke stops in Pokemon Go. I have included several tips that I implement to find Pokemon stops near me in this guide. Though, if you want to catch more Pokemons via Pokemon Go stops, then you can simply use Lure Modules. Apart from that, you can also use a dedicated location spoofer like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) to visit Pokemon stops anywhere in the world and replenish unlimited items without any trouble.</p><h2 id="The-Most-Useful-Tips-for-Pokemon-Go-Ultra-League-On-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max"><a href="#The-Most-Useful-Tips-for-Pokemon-Go-Ultra-League-On-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="The Most Useful Tips for Pokemon Go Ultra League On Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max"></a>The Most Useful Tips for Pokemon Go Ultra League On Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</h2><p>The Ultra League is one of the three leagues in the Pokemon Go Battle League.

Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much.

Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 15 Plus’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Plus and Launch the Application</strong></strong></p><p>At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to the system using a working cable and trust the system. On the interface of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), just agree to its terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Enter the Details of the Target Location</strong></strong></p><p>Once your Apple iPhone 15 Plus is detected by the interface, its present location would be displayed with other details. To spoof the location of your Apple iPhone 15 Plus on Pokemon Go, you can click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Now, you can go to the search options on the top-left side and enter the address or exact coordinates of the Pokestop.

Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking.

However, we recommend Mamoswine, because he isn’t just an ice-type Pokemon but also a strong ground-type Pokemon.</p><p>Once you defeat Team Go Rocket’s second lineup creatures, you will have to battle against the legendary psychic Pokemon, Mewtwo, who is weak to this set of Pokemon; bug, ghost, and Dark-type Pokemon. So beating this Pokemon Go Giovani grunt shouldn’t be a tedious task as you’ve got a plethora of choices when deciding the Pokemon-type to use. Origin Giratina and Tyranitar are some strong Dark-type Pokemon you can use to defeat Mewtwo.</p><p>Now you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against each lineup of creatures, leverage it to advance to the next phase of the game where you will face the big bad boss himself, Giovani.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Beat-Giovani-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Beat-Giovani-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max and Launch the Application</strong></strong></p><p>At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to the system using a working cable and trust the system. On the interface of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), just agree to its terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Enter the Details of the Target Location</strong></strong></p><p>Once your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is detected by the interface, its present location would be displayed with other details. To spoof the location of your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max on Pokemon Go, you can click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Now, you can go to the search options on the top-left side and enter the address or exact coordinates of the Pokestop.

Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 14 Pro’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro and Launch the Application</strong></strong></p><p>At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro to the system using a working cable and trust the system. On the interface of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), just agree to its terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Enter the Details of the Target Location</strong></strong></p><p>Once your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is detected by the interface, its present location would be displayed with other details. To spoof the location of your Apple iPhone 14 Pro on Pokemon Go, you can click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Now, you can go to the search options on the top-left side and enter the address or exact coordinates of the Pokestop. You can find the location of a Pokestop from several freely available online sources.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Location to a Pokemon stop</strong></strong></p><p>As you would enter the location, the interface will automatically change to the designated spot. You can now move the pin around on the map and even zoom in&#x2F;out to drop it at the exact spot.

For instance, if an egg would need 10 kilometers of walking, then change your location gradually instead of just switching it in one go. Here’s <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong> by using a GPS spoofer.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, unlock your Android phone and go to its Settings &gt; About Phone to tap the Build Number field 7 times.

Most of the eggs in Pokemon Go would need you to walk 2, 5, or 10 kilometers. The good news is that an average drone can easily cover this distance. Firstly, get a working drone on which you can easily place your phone. It is recommended to get a lock so that your device won’t fall while it is on a drone. Once your phone is successfully attached to a drone, just use it to cover a substantial distance. Make sure that the speed is minimal so that Pokemon Go would believe that you are walking instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-5.jpg"                      alt="Play Pokemon Go with a drone"                ></p><p><strong>Things to Remember</strong></p><ul><li>While doing so, don’t forget about the safety of your phone as it can get stolen by someone if it goes too far.</li><li>Use a lock and make sure that your phone won’t fall from your drone.</li><li>Enable the Find My Apple iPhone 14 Pro service on your Android or iPhone so that you can locate your phone if it is lost.</li><li>Move your drone slowly so that Pokemon Go would not detect that you are using a drone or playing the game while driving.</li></ul><h2 id="Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users"><a href="#Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users" class="headerlink" title="Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users"></a>Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users</h2><p>A while back, Pokemon Go enabled the option to add friends on the app and send them gifts. Presently, we can send gifts to 20 other friends from our account in a day. Therefore, if you have a lot of friends, then you can send them eggs, including the exclusive 7 km egg. There are tons of online sources and forums for people to exchange their friend codes for Pokemon Go.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, Launch Pokemon Go on your phone and go to your profile.

There are all kinds of incubators available in the game that can help you hatch eggs without walking much.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, make sure that you have enough Pokecoins with you.

You can just place your phone carefully on your bike or skateboard and cover the needed distance to hatch more eggs. While you would still have to go out for this, the effort needed would be far less than walking.</p><p>Just make sure that you stay safe while riding your bike or skateboard. Don’t focus too much on catching new Pokemons. Instead, just cover the needed distance to hatch the egg. Also, ride your bike or skateboard slowly to make sure Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-10.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Bike or Skateboard"                ></p><h2 id="Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go"></a>Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you have a Roomba or any other robotic cleaner in the house, then you can also take its assistance to hack Pokemon Go eggs. All you got to do is place your phone on the Roomba and let it move around in your house. Since the robotic cleaner would move slowly, it will make Pokemon Go believe that you are walking instead. Just be sure that your phone will stay safe and protected.

It would be the replica of a big railroad with miniature trains. Simply place your phone on a miniature train and let it revolve around the railroad to cover the distance. Just keep your phone safe and regulate the speed of the train to make sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement. You would have to drive your train for a while to cover the distance, but you don’t have to walk to do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-12.jpg"                      alt="Model Railroad"                ></p><h2 id="Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go"></a>Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go</h2><p>Do you have a turntable?

Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 14 Plus’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 14 Plus and Launch the Application</strong></strong></p><p>At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 14 Plus to the system using a working cable and trust the system. On the interface of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), just agree to its terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Enter the Details of the Target Location</strong></strong></p><p>Once your Apple iPhone 14 Plus is detected by the interface, its present location would be displayed with other details. To spoof the location of your Apple iPhone 14 Plus on Pokemon Go, you can click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Now, you can go to the search options on the top-left side and enter the address or exact coordinates of the Pokestop. You can find the location of a Pokestop from several freely available online sources.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone 14 Plus Location to a Pokemon stop</strong></strong></p><p>As you would enter the location, the interface will automatically change to the designated spot. You can now move the pin around on the map and even zoom in&#x2F;out to drop it at the exact spot. In the end, just click on the “Move Here” button to spoof your Apple iPhone 14 Plus’s location and visit the Pokemon stop virtually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Besides that, you can also use the one-stop or multi-stop modes of the application to simulate your movement and visit the nearby Pokemon Go stops.</p><p>I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to know about Poke stops in Pokemon Go. I have included several tips that I implement to find Pokemon stops near me in this guide. Though, if you want to catch more Pokemons via Pokemon Go stops, then you can simply use Lure Modules.

Some players could simply use “charged moves” repetitively without recharging. Thankfully Niantic is coming up with a fix.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-the-Go-battle-league-known-issues"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-the-Go-battle-league-known-issues" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are the Go battle league known issues?"></a>Part 1: What are the Go battle league known issues?</h2><p>Pokémon Go as a game, is constantly evolving to improve the trainer’s experience which involves finding issues and resolving them. Like all other games, the publisher always tries their best to make the user experience more enriching and fair for the users.</p><p>Season 1 of the Battle League’s had a severe bug that a handful of players exploited to rise to the leader board. After a player has lodged few fast moves, (number of fast moves required for each Pokémon to charge attack, varies) the trainer’s Pokémon can lodge a secondary yet stronger charged attack to deal more damage.</p><p>The bug in the series implied that a Pokémon – “Melmetal” is able to recharge their charge attack even while attacking with a “Charged” move, essentially making the trainer using the Pokémon invincible during a real battle.</p><p>Several trainers immediately tweeted this excruciating bug to Niantic requesting this issue to be resolved immediately, as a result Niantic had to freeze the leader board for that season.</p><p>Players when entering the Battle League are shown – Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available Right Now, and all matches that were in progress were not concluded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-1.jpg"                      alt="pokemon 1"                ></p><p>Thankfully, the issue has been resolved and trainers can get back into the league without any change in the previous features.</p><p>Here’s a set of few known issues in the game currently being investigated by Niantic, which we can hope to see resolved later on in the future;</p><ul><li><strong>Inconsistent Fast Attacks against Opponent Charged Attacks –</strong> Your fast attacks don’t land a direct hit when the opponent is throwing his Charged Attack.</li><li><strong>Fast Attacks are slower on Android –</strong> Most android users are experiencing slower fast attacks than iOS users. Niantic has addressed the issue and are awaiting more reports on the issue.</li><li><strong>Charged Attack Button doesn’t work when tapped -</strong> Occasionally after few uses, the Charged Attack button fails to respond when tapped resulting in slower attacks during matches.</li><li><strong>Go Battle wins are not counted –</strong> Some times, a Go battle win is not counted in the Go Battle League Set and remains unrecorded in the journal.</li><li><strong>Animation Glitch of the trainer throwing a Poke ball –</strong> A glitch occurs occasionally when the trainer avatar is seen throwing a Poke Ball repetitively.</li><li><strong>Disappearance of the Charged Attack and Switch Button –</strong> The button of the Charge Attack and the Switch Pokémon button would eventually disappear in-enabling the trainer to take any action during live battle.</li><li><strong>Next Battle tab not showing up on the Post-win Screen –</strong> After ending a match or winning a battle, the button for the ‘Next Battle’ option disappears from the Post-win screen.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Why-does-the-go-battle-not-available"><a href="#Part-2-Why-does-the-go-battle-not-available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why does the go battle not available?"></a>Part 2: Why does the go battle not available?</h2><p>It’s not new for an augmented reality game to have bugs that impede on the fun aspect of the game, but the recent development to Pokémon Go included an update trainers have been waiting for since its release in 2016.</p><p>Battle League is a brand new additional feature to the game that allows players to play PVP or one on one matches with other trainers. Ninantic introduced Battle tournaments to be played in three leagues – Great, Ultra and Master, that gives trainers the opportunity to compete and gain dominance over score board.</p><p>Pokémon Go is now exploring its roots with Pvp being a part of the original game franchise. We can hope to see the game evolve into a platform for global players to go head to head with each other.</p><p>The first season of Pokémon Go Battle League had to be temporarily frozen due to prevalence of broken code (a.k.a. – bug) that created a loophole allowing certain players and unfair advantage.</p><p>After attacking your opponent with a Charge move, the move set requires a brief time to recharge in order for the player to be able to use it again.</p><p>Few players with the assist of Melmetal (ground and steel type) could lodge constant fast attacks while also using Charge moves with no recharge time. This landed a handful these players to skyrocket to the leader board.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon 2"                ></p><p>After this issue was tweeted to the notice of the game publisher, Ninattic temporarily paused Battle League.

Battle League presents itself as an event in the game which gives trainers the chance to earn bonuses and stardust.</p><p>Even so, Pokémon Go continues to resolve issues as they come along and this shows us how there is so much more to look forward to.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Here’s-Everything-You-Should-Know-About-Pokemon-Stops-in-Detail-On-Apple-iPhone-14"><a href="#Here’s-Everything-You-Should-Know-About-Pokemon-Stops-in-Detail-On-Apple-iPhone-14" class="headerlink" title="Here’s Everything You Should Know About Pokemon Stops in Detail On Apple iPhone 14"></a>Here’s Everything You Should Know About Pokemon Stops in Detail On Apple iPhone 14</h2><p>If you are just starting with Pokemon Go, then you might see Pokemon stops all around you! Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options.

With special research, you don’t have all that much flexibility.</p><p>Professor Willow will contact you directly and give you specific tasks you must complete. You can’t disregard or discard them.</p><p>As a rule, special research will be more involved and will likely last longer than field research. However, your rewards will usually be much more valuable, and you’ll exponentially increase your chances of obtaining a Sun Stone.</p><h3 id="Gyms-and-PokeStops"><a href="#Gyms-and-PokeStops" class="headerlink" title="Gyms and PokeStops"></a>Gyms and PokeStops</h3><p>Of course, you can always earn valuable rewards by simply visiting gyms and PokéStops and spinning the Photo Discs. Create a 7-day PokéStop streak, as that will guarantee you’ll get an evolution item.</p><p>While you’ll usually get a more common evolution item after your 7-day streak, you might get a Sun Stone or something even more valuable.</p><p>Usually, it’s in your best interest to go to more popular areas with more PokéStops, as you’ll be able to make more spins faster.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Gather-Sun-Stones-Efficiently"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Gather-Sun-Stones-Efficiently" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. How to Gather Sun Stones Efficiently"></a>Part 5. How to Gather Sun Stones Efficiently</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-6.jpg"                      alt="Text” sun stone in pokemon go"                ></p><p>Field research, special research, and spinning gyms and PokéStops are the only ways you could acquire the Sun Stone in Pokémon Go. However, that doesn’t mean you’ll need to grind day in and day out, trying to explore as much of your neighborhood as possible while playing. You can always make things a bit more efficient than that.</p><h3 id="Complete-Field-Research-Tasks-Quickly"><a href="#Complete-Field-Research-Tasks-Quickly" class="headerlink" title="Complete Field Research Tasks Quickly"></a>Complete Field Research Tasks Quickly</h3><p>Mention Dr. Fone Virtual Location and Add Steps.</p><p>To complete field research and increase your chances of getting a Sun Stone, you’ll usually have to spend a lot of your time wandering around your neighborhood. After all, Pokémon Go is a location-based game that requires you to go out into town and wander the streets of your city. There’s virtually no task you can complete from the comfort of your home unless you have an ace up your sleeve.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone virtual location can be a game-changer for completing your field research tasks quickly. A tool designed to spoof your location and make it seem like you’re out and about while you’re actually just relaxing at home, it can help you finish your field research without much fuss.</p><p>You can use the Dr. Fone virtual location to set your location to anywhere in the world. Create a one-stop or multi-stop route to make the game believe you’re moving around, or even use the jump-teleport mode to “transfer” to a more resource-rich location. However, be careful with the jump-teleport mode, as it can betray the fact that you’re using a location spoofer.</p><p>To get started with Wondershare Dr.Fone and complete your field research tasks, you must follow a few steps:</p><ol><li>Download and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer;</li><li>Connect your phone to your computer;</li><li>Go to <strong>Toolbox &gt; Virtual Location &gt; Get Started</strong>;</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="get started with wondershare dr.fone"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>On the map that shows up, click on <strong>No Device</strong>in the upper right-hand corner;</li><li>You’ll see a list of all connected devices, select your phone;</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-1.png"                      alt="choose the Apple iPhone 14 device you want to connect to dr.fone"                ></p><ol start="6"><li>On your phone, tap <strong>Allow USB Debugging</strong>;</li><li>On your phone, go to <strong>Developer Options&gt; Select mock location app</strong>;</li><li>Select <strong>Fone</strong>.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-3.png"                      alt="set up mock location on your phone"                ></p><p>From there, you can easily set up your route, change your location, and simulate movement. With Wondershare Dr.Fone, you’ll have intuitive keyboard controls, 360-degree directions, and automated movement. So, as soon as you set things up in the app, you can start playing the game, completing your field research tasks, and, hopefully, acquiring your Sun Stones.</p><h3 id="Pay-Attention-to-Community-Days-and-Special-Events"><a href="#Pay-Attention-to-Community-Days-and-Special-Events" class="headerlink" title="Pay Attention to Community Days and Special Events"></a>Pay Attention to Community Days and Special Events</h3><p>Finally, to start getting Sun Stones and other rarer items more efficiently, you’ll always want to pay close attention to community days and special events. Pokémon Go is a very active game with frequent high-rewarding events that could happen at any time. Since these events are time-limited, you’ll always want to know precisely when they start and end.</p><p>Fortunately, finding this out is pretty easy. Just keep track of Pokémon Go on social media or visit the official Pokémon Go website to find out more. All events will be announced ahead of time so that you can prepare.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Acquiring Sun Stones for Pokémon evolutions can be quite a hassle. This rare evolution item can be a tricky find. Still, simply playing the game and joining all events, completing your research tasks, and more can significantly increase your chances of coming across a Sun Stone – especially if you have the help of apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-come-up-with-the-best-pokemon-team-on-apple-iphone-6-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Come up With the Best Pokemon Team On Apple iPhone 6?

Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and Launch the Application</strong></strong></p><p>At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to the system using a working cable and trust the system. On the interface of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), just agree to its terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Enter the Details of the Target Location</strong></strong></p><p>Once your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max is detected by the interface, its present location would be displayed with other details. To spoof the location of your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max on Pokemon Go, you can click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Now, you can go to the search options on the top-left side and enter the address or exact coordinates of the Pokestop. You can find the location of a Pokestop from several freely available online sources.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max Location to a Pokemon stop</strong></strong></p><p>As you would enter the location, the interface will automatically change to the designated spot. You can now move the pin around on the map and even zoom in&#x2F;out to drop it at the exact spot. In the end, just click on the “Move Here” button to spoof your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max’s location and visit the Pokemon stop virtually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Besides that, you can also use the one-stop or multi-stop modes of the application to simulate your movement and visit the nearby Pokemon Go stops.</p><p>I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to know about Poke stops in Pokemon Go. I have included several tips that I implement to find Pokemon stops near me in this guide. Though, if you want to catch more Pokemons via Pokemon Go stops, then you can simply use Lure Modules. Apart from that, you can also use a dedicated location spoofer like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) to visit Pokemon stops anywhere in the world and replenish unlimited items without any trouble.</p><h2 id="How-to-get-the-dragon-scale-and-evolution-enabled-pokemon-On-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max"><a href="#How-to-get-the-dragon-scale-and-evolution-enabled-pokemon-On-Apple-iPhone-13-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="How to get the dragon scale and evolution-enabled pokemon On Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max?"></a>How to get the dragon scale and evolution-enabled pokemon On Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max?</h2><p>The Dragon Scale is a special item in Pokémon Go that is used to evolve Seadra into Kingdra. To get a Dragon Scale in the game, you need to complete the 7-day Research Breakthrough. This means that you need to complete a Field Research task every day for 7 days to get the Dragon Scale. Once you have the Dragon Scale, you can use it to evolve Seadra into Kingdra.</p><p>Dragon scales in Pokémon GO are extremely exceptional and are utterly crucial in evolving pokemon. Pokemon go dragon scale evolutions can be as easy as utilizing the necessary amount of candy, but frequently scarce evolutions will call for an evolution object. These are usable that not only let you fill in your Pokedex but also gain access to many impactful beasts. There are several different ways to get a Dragon Scale, but none of them is guaranteed. This implies that you will have to accomplish as many of these tasks that are feasible – peculiarly because you can make use of them only once. Perhaps the simplest way of gaining a Dragon Scale is spinning Pokestops wherever likely. Each Pokestop comes up with a 1% probability of an evolution object, encompassing a Dragon Scale.</p><p>Following are the additional evolution items observed in Pokémon Go:</p><ul><li>King’s Rock</li><li>Metal Coat</li><li>Sinnoh Stone</li><li>Sun Stone</li><li>Unova Stone</li><li>Upgrade</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1：What-Pokemon-can-I-evolve-with-a-dragon-scale-on-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1：What-Pokemon-can-I-evolve-with-a-dragon-scale-on-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1：What Pokémon can I evolve with a dragon scale on Pokémon Go?"></a>Part 1：What Pokémon can I evolve with a dragon scale on Pokémon Go?</h2><p>The pokemon go dragon scale is one of the new evolution objects that can be employed in association with Pokemon Candy to evolve some of the generation 1 Pokemon to new generation 2 evolutions. The dragon scale is extremely strong and rigid. We can only make use of our Dragon Scale on a specific Pokemon. Dragon scale pokemon go evolutions contain the alteration of Seadra into Kingdra by combining the dragon scale along with 100 Horsea candies - making Kingdra a sturdy pocket monster ideal for raids and taking charge over the gyms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/seadra-evolving-to-kingdra.jpg"                      alt="seadra evolving to kingdra"                ></p><p>Once receiving a Dragon Scale, a player can only use it to evolve Seadra. Any other Pokemon will not evolve with it or even need it to evolve.</p><h2 id="Part-2：Fast-way-to-get-the-exclusive-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-2：Fast-way-to-get-the-exclusive-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 2：Fast way to get the exclusive Pokémon?"></a>Part 2：Fast way to get the exclusive Pokémon?</h2><p>You can make use of the artificial locality of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to imitate your position without any motion and acquire exclusive Pokémon. The duplicate point of Dr. Fone lets you phony your orientation and permits your mobile application to presume that you are chosen in the app interface of Dr. Fone without being banned from the game or getting detected by the developers of Pokemon Go.

At the foot of the screen, the rate of motion can also be modified, making use of the gliding menu. By following these steps, you can use the fake motion of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without needing to understand it, and your app will not be banned.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="virtual location 10"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="virtual location 11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:</strong></p><p>Dr. Fone’s application also lets you fake your motion joining more than two positions. The attribute is called after the multi-stop path that can be highlighted from the GUI toolbox class situated at the top-right position, which allows you to release several accurate endpoints on the map, and your position will take action correspondingly as managed by the virtual position application of Dr. Fone.</p><p>To let the system duplicate flow by choosing the accurate choices, press the ‘March’ button.

Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 13 Pro’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 13 Pro and Launch the Application</strong></strong></p><p>At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 13 Pro to the system using a working cable and trust the system. On the interface of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), just agree to its terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Enter the Details of the Target Location</strong></strong></p><p>Once your Apple iPhone 13 Pro is detected by the interface, its present location would be displayed with other details. To spoof the location of your Apple iPhone 13 Pro on Pokemon Go, you can click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Now, you can go to the search options on the top-left side and enter the address or exact coordinates of the Pokestop. You can find the location of a Pokestop from several freely available online sources.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Location to a Pokemon stop</strong></strong></p><p>As you would enter the location, the interface will automatically change to the designated spot. You can now move the pin around on the map and even zoom in&#x2F;out to drop it at the exact spot.

Therefore, you will get caught easily.</li><li>You need to be very careful about your movement in the game. If you are using a fake GPS app, then make sure your movements are reasonable. It means do not switch long-distance locations in few hours or frequently. It is because this makes it unreal in Niantic radar and may cause you a problem.</li><li>Finally, do not root your Phone, be it Android or iPhone. It is because when you root your device, its security gets compromised, and it is easy to get data about your device’s fake location.

Use Wondershare Dr.Fone to progress swiftly through the game and catch them all!</p><h2 id="Part-6-Pokemon-GO-Regional-Spawns-and-Events"><a href="#Part-6-Pokemon-GO-Regional-Spawns-and-Events" class="headerlink" title="Part 6. Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events"></a>Part 6. Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events</h2><p>While incredibly straightforward and helpful, changing your virtual location isn’t the only way you can go about catching Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures.</p><p>The game’s special events often remove regional Pokemon distribution restrictions, allowing exclusive creatures to spawn around the globe for a particular period. With these, you can find and catch Asia-specific Pokemon in North America and vice versa.</p><p>It’s worth noting that these special events are pretty rare in Pokemon GO. You’ll need to pay close attention to the game’s announcements, as you don’t want to miss an opportunity to add another, hard-to-find, regional Pokemon to your Pokedex.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Trading-Regional-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-7-Trading-Regional-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon"></a>Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon</h2><p>As mentioned above, trading regional Pokemon GO exclusives is another one of your options if you can’t or don’t want to travel. Players can find other users from around the globe and initiate Pokemon GO creature exchanges to complete their Pokedex with all the available regionals.</p><p>However, trading regional Pokemon can also be quite challenging as it requires finding users willing to swap their region-specific Pokemon for the ones you have. There’ll undoubtedly be situations where users might not want to give up a more valuable catch for the one in your region, making trading a less viable option than changing your virtual location.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Completing your Pokedex and becoming the ultimate Pokemon trainer in Niantic’s viral AR game can be particularly challenging due to Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures. To catch these, players must travel to regions where these Pokemon spawn, trade with other users who’ve visited these areas, or wait for the game’s special events to lift regional spawn restrictions.</p><p>Alternatively, Pokemon trainers can use GPS-spoofing apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone and its Virtual Location Changer feature to change their mobile device’s GPS location. This helpful feature lets players move without moving and travel to specific regional spawn points without physically going there.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/9-mind-blowing-tricks-to-hatch-eggs-in-pokemon-go-without-walking-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>9 Mind-Blowing Tricks to Hatch Eggs in Pokemon Go Without Walking On Apple iPhone 13 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/is-mega-mewtwo-the-strongest-pokemon-on-apple-iphone-6-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Is Mega Mewtwo The Strongest Pokémon On Apple iPhone 6 Plus?

Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 13 mini’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 13 mini and Launch the Application</strong></strong></p><p>At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 13 mini to the system using a working cable and trust the system. On the interface of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), just agree to its terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Enter the Details of the Target Location</strong></strong></p><p>Once your Apple iPhone 13 mini is detected by the interface, its present location would be displayed with other details. To spoof the location of your Apple iPhone 13 mini on Pokemon Go, you can click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Now, you can go to the search options on the top-left side and enter the address or exact coordinates of the Pokestop. You can find the location of a Pokestop from several freely available online sources.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone 13 mini Location to a Pokemon stop</strong></strong></p><p>As you would enter the location, the interface will automatically change to the designated spot. You can now move the pin around on the map and even zoom in&#x2F;out to drop it at the exact spot. In the end, just click on the “Move Here” button to spoof your Apple iPhone 13 mini’s location and visit the Pokemon stop virtually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Besides that, you can also use the one-stop or multi-stop modes of the application to simulate your movement and visit the nearby Pokemon Go stops.</p><p>I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to know about Poke stops in Pokemon Go. I have included several tips that I implement to find Pokemon stops near me in this guide. Though, if you want to catch more Pokemons via Pokemon Go stops, then you can simply use Lure Modules. Apart from that, you can also use a dedicated location spoofer like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) to visit Pokemon stops anywhere in the world and replenish unlimited items without any trouble.</p><h2 id="Why-is-iPogo-not-working-On-Apple-iPhone-13-mini-Fixed"><a href="#Why-is-iPogo-not-working-On-Apple-iPhone-13-mini-Fixed" class="headerlink" title="Why is iPogo not working On Apple iPhone 13 mini? Fixed"></a>Why is iPogo not working On Apple iPhone 13 mini? Fixed</h2><p>The popular iPogo app is one of the best free apps you can use to spoof on your device while playing Pokémon Go. It is equipped with an abundance of features that allows players to get way ahead in the game by spotting spawns early, catching gym raids, discovering nests and quest events, and so on. If you spot a Pokémon which is way too far from your location, you can use iPogo to fake your virtual coordinates and trick Pokémon Go to think you are nearby that area. Sounds like an amazing app to use right? But, there is a downside to it too as users of the app have repeatedly reported of iPogo not working. The app seems to overload and malfunction after a few hours of repeated usage. This issue is preventing users from harnessing the full potential of their gaming experience.</p><h3 id="Why-Users-download-iPogo"><a href="#Why-Users-download-iPogo" class="headerlink" title="Why Users download iPogo?"></a>Why Users download iPogo?</h3><p>iPogo is a free to use Pokémon Go++ mod which can be downloaded as an APK file for your iOS devices. It features tools that can be used by players to play the game virtually anywhere in the world while also enhancing the gameplay experience. Few of these exclusive features have been mentioned in the list below;</p><ul><li>The Spin and Auto-cash feature can be used to capture Pokémon and throw a spinning ball without requiring a physical device.</li><li>With just one click you can manage your collection of stored items. It removes the cumbersome ordeal of the game to manually select and delete items when you can erase all un-required items with just one tap.</li><li>If you are on the hunt for special shiny Pokémon, you can do so without having to go through dozens of non-shiny one’s. On activating the Auto-Runaway feature on your iPogo, you can skip through the time consuming animations of all non-shiny Pokémon.</li><li>You can augment the game to let your avatar walk continuously at a desired pace. The speed of your avatar’s movement can be adjusted using iPogo.</li><li>If there are unnecessary elements crowding up your screen, you can hide them temporarily.</li><li>You keep track of Pokémon spawns, quests and raids using the feed on your iPogo.</li></ul><p>With all these amazing benefits at hand, it seems almost unfair to not be able to make the best of it if iPogo keeps crashing or stops working. Let’s look into the probable reasons why your iPogo is not working and explore methods to solve this dilemma.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-problem-that-iPogo-is-not-working"><a href="#Part-1-Common-problem-that-iPogo-is-not-working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working"></a>Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working</h2><p>Pokémon Go players have made several reports of how iPogo is not functioning normally on their devices. For instance, while using the Plus mod on Pokémon Go, the Apple iPhone 13 mini device screen goes completely black and unresponsive making the game inaccessible. Also, devices that run Pokémon Go with iPogo seems to be running slower than those which do not use any helper or spoofing support.</p><p>Even if your device is able to withstand the load of using iPogo, it may still be possible to face other app related performance issues like ipogo enhanced-throw not working, ipogo joystick not working and ipogo feeds not working either. All these symptoms sums up the fact that the iPogo app is faltering on your device.</p><p>Read on to understand the reasons why your device is unable to run the iPogo mod smoothly;</p><ul><li>One of the root causes which explains why iPogo is crashing could be because you are utilizing too much of your phone’s system resource capacity. This means you have too many tabs or other applications opened on your device that is making the resource distribution falter leading to an automatic shutdown.</li><li>Another plausible reason could be that your iPogo application has not been properly installed. It is widely agreed upon that iPogo is a difficult app to install as it involves going through complex steps making it easier for mistakes to be made, eventually leading to a complete breakdown of the software.</li><li>Since installing iPogo is a cumbersome process, players would often resort to using downloading hacks to get the job done faster. However, not all such hacks can be relied upon as they may end up jail breaking your device or make your version of the app even more unstable.</li></ul><h3 id="Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue"><a href="#Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue" class="headerlink" title="Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue"></a>Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue</h3><p>It is often said that short cuts can cut you short or in this case, hacked! Disrupting the framework of your device is not price you should pay for enjoying the game at its best. Although, there are other safer and more reliable solutions to making the iPogo app run better on your iOS device. Let’s take a brief peak at some of them.</p><ul><li><strong>Limiting the usage of System Resources:</strong> Let’s keep in mind that it is unwise to keep too much on your plate and rightfully so. In this case, the more applications you keep active on your shortcut bar, the lesser resources your CPU has left to allocate to the iPogo app. Therefore, close off all other unnecessary applications before launching iPogo as it is already a heavy enough application to run on its own.</li><li><strong>Too many Items opened:</strong> Keep a tight check on your list of inventory while playing Pokémon Go using iPogo. Remember to delete all un-required collected items as it may be taking up too much space and wasting precious system resources.</li><li><strong>Keep you Device Clean:</strong> Not essentially in the literal sense but yes, it is indeed important to clean up your device often. Use a cleaner app that deletes and clears all those extra cache files that becomes the primary reason of system lag on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Install the Official Version:</strong> It may be tempting for anyone to install the app using shortcut hacks, but that’s all they are – just hacks! Installing iPogo seem like the long way but it is the right way on all accounts. There are three methods you can use to integrate the official iPogo app, all of which has been made more simplified.</li></ul><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Use the three-step app installation method which is direct and free to use.</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If you are opting for a matrix installation, in which case you will need a PC installed with either Windows, LINUX or MacOS.</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> The Signulous method is a premium mod that gives the player access to additional features.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> All of these installation methods have specific varied requirements which must be checked appropriately.</p><h2 id="Part-2-A-better-alternative-for-iPogo-virtual-location"><a href="#Part-2-A-better-alternative-for-iPogo-virtual-location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location"></a>Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location</h2><p>If using the iPogo mod to enhance your gaming experience on Pokémon Go seem less appealing with all the added hassle then there is a better alternative for you to use. You can employ a much simpler and easier to install GPS mocking application like Wondershare’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It offers amazing user-friendly features like speed modulation, joystick control and map routing with none of the drawbacks that you had to previously overcome.

As the name suggests it is a feature in Pokémon Go that lets you battle as a trainer against the other trainers. Pokémon Go trainer battles are a great way to enhance your skills as the rules are different from the gym and raid battles which are also a great feature of this game. The Pokémon CP limits are granted to each league from which the trainer needs to choose one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 1"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Point-of-Trainer-Battles-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Point-of-Trainer-Battles-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the Point of Trainer Battles in Pokémon Go?"></a>Part 1: What is the Point of Trainer Battles in Pokémon Go?</h2><p>The best part is that the teams are assembled by the trainers themselves. The point of the trainer battles is that a winning team is chosen while competing with the other players. The trainer battles Pokémon Go also lets the trainers choose the best players that would charge and power up Pokémon. Different spoils are embedded within the trainer battles and they all are worth trying. Once the trainer battles he is rewarded three times per day as a normal team leader. As an AI team leader, you can get the reward once every day.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 2"                ></p><p>Now you want to make sure that the charged attacks are learned and how they can be used as a weapon against the other players. The Pokémon should also be chosen as per the ability as different Pokémon have different charged attack ability overall. The Pokémon is of a different kind as all benefit from the charge attack in different states. It also means that you get to choose Pokémon like Tyranitar which will get you to through the battle with highly advanced skills. Typhlosion is a dual-type Pokémon and the raids which are done using it benefit the trainers as compared to single types.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-can-you-get-from-trainer-battles-Pokemon-go"><a href="#Part-2-What-can-you-get-from-trainer-battles-Pokemon-go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?"></a>Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?</h2><p>This part will deal with the rewards which the trainers will get for the battles which they will fight.

The CP stands for combat power and it means the power of your Pokémon. As a trainer when you battle more and more the XP increases and the CP as well. This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pokémon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pokémon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pokémon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pokémon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pokémon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pokémon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you. Use candies and power up your Pokémon to a higher level. It will also ensure that you get the best results on the battlefield. The weight and the size of the Pokémon also affect the CP score so you need a Pokémon that is both agile and lightweight to get the best results.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Tips-to-level-up-Pokemon-before-doing-the-Pokemon-go-trainer-battles"><a href="#Part-4-Tips-to-level-up-Pokemon-before-doing-the-Pokemon-go-trainer-battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Tips to level up Pokémon before doing the Pokémon go trainer battles"></a>Part 4: Tips to level up Pokémon before doing the Pokémon go trainer battles</h2><p>To get the best out of Pokémon Go battle another trainer it is advised to get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 13’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 13 and Launch the Application</strong></strong></p><p>At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 13 to the system using a working cable and trust the system. On the interface of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), just agree to its terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Enter the Details of the Target Location</strong></strong></p><p>Once your Apple iPhone 13 is detected by the interface, its present location would be displayed with other details. To spoof the location of your Apple iPhone 13 on Pokemon Go, you can click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Now, you can go to the search options on the top-left side and enter the address or exact coordinates of the Pokestop. You can find the location of a Pokestop from several freely available online sources.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone 13 Location to a Pokemon stop</strong></strong></p><p>As you would enter the location, the interface will automatically change to the designated spot. You can now move the pin around on the map and even zoom in&#x2F;out to drop it at the exact spot. In the end, just click on the “Move Here” button to spoof your Apple iPhone 13’s location and visit the Pokemon stop virtually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Besides that, you can also use the one-stop or multi-stop modes of the application to simulate your movement and visit the nearby Pokemon Go stops.</p><p>I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to know about Poke stops in Pokemon Go. I have included several tips that I implement to find Pokemon stops near me in this guide. Though, if you want to catch more Pokemons via Pokemon Go stops, then you can simply use Lure Modules. Apart from that, you can also use a dedicated location spoofer like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) to visit Pokemon stops anywhere in the world and replenish unlimited items without any trouble.</p><h2 id="A-Comprehensive-Guide-to-Mastering-iPogo-for-Pokemon-GO-On-Apple-iPhone-13"><a href="#A-Comprehensive-Guide-to-Mastering-iPogo-for-Pokemon-GO-On-Apple-iPhone-13" class="headerlink" title="A Comprehensive Guide to Mastering iPogo for Pokémon GO On Apple iPhone 13"></a>A Comprehensive Guide to Mastering iPogo for Pokémon GO On Apple iPhone 13</h2><p>Pokémon Go is one of the most popular gaming apps of the present times, which is based on augmented reality. Developed by Niantic for iOS and Android, this single console game lets us catch all sorts of Pokemons in different areas. Though, to catch Pokemons, users are expected to visit different places and step out. Needless to say, it restricts the scope to <a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/pokemon-go/best-pokemon-type.html" >catch Pokemons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and users often look for Pokémon Go spoofing apps for iOS.

While the iPogo iOS app has gained a lot of popularity, it also suffers from security and accessibility issues. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to use iPogo for Pokemon Go and would also make you familiar with a better alternative for Pokemon Go location spoofing.</p><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Discover the best iPogo alternatives!

Also, since the use of iPogo for Pokemon Go can lead to an account ban, you can consider creating a new account before using it. Here’s how you can use the iPogo iOS app to spoof location on Pokemon Go.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download and Install the iPogo iOS app</strong></p><p>At first, you can just jailbreak your device by using any freely available resource that would install Cydia Impactor on it. Later, you can go to the website of iPogo to download the IPA file and complete its installation. You can also use third-party sources like 3uTools, Rickpactor, or Signulous to install iPogo on your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/2021/guide-for-ipogo-2.jpg"                      alt="Download iPogo IPA"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Set up your Pokemon Go account</strong></p><p>Great!

This will automatically switch your location, letting you catch Pokemons from your home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/2021/guide-for-ipogo-4.jpg"                      alt="iPogo Location Spoofing"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Why-you-Should-Look-for-iPogo-Alternatives"><a href="#Part-3-Why-you-Should-Look-for-iPogo-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Why you Should Look for iPogo Alternatives?"></a>Part 3: Why you Should Look for iPogo Alternatives?</h2><p>Even though iPogo would let you access all kinds of Pokemon Go hacks, it has numerous pitfalls. Here are some of the reasons that would make you look for a better iPogo alternative instead.</p><ul><li>Firstly, the iPogo iOS app would need <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/how-to-jailbreak-ios-on-windows.html" >jailbreak access on your Apple iPhone 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which can compromise its security.</li><li>As of now, iPogo is only available for iOS devices and not Android.

Evolving your Pokémon is how you advance through the game, level up, and become a better catcher.</p><p>Now, while some of your Pokémon in the game can evolve with the utmost ease, others require a bit more of a special touch, and that special touch comes in the form of evolution items. Necessary for certain species of Pokémon, evolution items can be somewhat elusive – one of the rarer ones being the Sun Stone.</p><p><strong>Pokémon Go Sun Stone evolutions</strong> can improve your entire in-game experience, so learn all about them below.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Sun-Stones-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Sun-Stones-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

You’ll most commonly get species-specific candy used for evolutions whenever you catch a specific Pokémon. Depending on the species, you’ll need more or less candy to evolve them. (And don’t worry, evolutions don’t affect the total number of Pokémon in your collection).</p><p>Depending on the specific Pokémon you want to evolve, you might need additional items or even need to perform a particular task. Some Pokémon will need to be walked as your Buddy Pokémon before they can evolve. Others can be evolved through trading them. Others can only evolve with the help of evolution items like the Sun Stone.</p><p>Pokémon Sun Stone evolutions will require you to collect the Sun Stone and a certain amount of candy (which can vary by Pokémon).</p><p>You can always check out how to evolve your Pokémon in your Pokédex.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Which-Pokemon-Evolve-With-Sun-Stones"><a href="#Part-3-Which-Pokemon-Evolve-With-Sun-Stones" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

You can get excellent XP bonuses, come across special Pokémon, enjoy more candy and stardust, encounter special raid bosses, and so much more. Of course, you can also increase your chances of encountering rare evolution items like the Sun Stone.</p><p>Pokémon Go will frequently have multiple special events happening every month. Some of the events happening in February 2024 include:</p><ul><li>Lunar New Year – February 5 to February 11;</li><li>Carnival of Love – February 13 to February 15;</li><li>Road to Sinnoh – February 19 to February 23.</li></ul><p>You’ll be notified of any ongoing special events as soon as you start your game, so check your phone at least once daily.

Of course, you’ll always be generously rewarded for your efforts.</p><p>Among the different types of research the professor sends you is field research. You can collect your field research tasks by spinning the Photo Disc at a PokéStop. You can only collect and work on three field research tasks simultaneously, though a fourth one will open if you receive bonus research. Moreover, you and your friends can work together to complete the same field research if you all go to the same PokéStop on the same day.</p><p>As you’re completing your field research tasks, you can collect your rewards, earn stamps, and unlock breakthroughs. Hopefully, one of the rewards you receive will include the Sun Stone, allowing you to evolve some of your Pokémon.</p><h3 id="Special-Research"><a href="#Special-Research" class="headerlink" title="Special Research"></a>Special Research</h3><p>With field research, you have some flexibility. You can visit PokéStops when you’re up for them, and you can even discard some tasks if they’re too difficult for you. With special research, you don’t have all that much flexibility.</p><p>Professor Willow will contact you directly and give you specific tasks you must complete. You can’t disregard or discard them.</p><p>As a rule, special research will be more involved and will likely last longer than field research. However, your rewards will usually be much more valuable, and you’ll exponentially increase your chances of obtaining a Sun Stone.</p><h3 id="Gyms-and-PokeStops"><a href="#Gyms-and-PokeStops" class="headerlink" title="Gyms and PokeStops"></a>Gyms and PokeStops</h3><p>Of course, you can always earn valuable rewards by simply visiting gyms and PokéStops and spinning the Photo Discs. Create a 7-day PokéStop streak, as that will guarantee you’ll get an evolution item.</p><p>While you’ll usually get a more common evolution item after your 7-day streak, you might get a Sun Stone or something even more valuable.</p><p>Usually, it’s in your best interest to go to more popular areas with more PokéStops, as you’ll be able to make more spins faster.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Gather-Sun-Stones-Efficiently"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Gather-Sun-Stones-Efficiently" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

After all, Pokémon Go is a location-based game that requires you to go out into town and wander the streets of your city. There’s virtually no task you can complete from the comfort of your home unless you have an ace up your sleeve.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone virtual location can be a game-changer for completing your field research tasks quickly. A tool designed to spoof your location and make it seem like you’re out and about while you’re actually just relaxing at home, it can help you finish your field research without much fuss.</p><p>You can use the Dr. Fone virtual location to set your location to anywhere in the world. Create a one-stop or multi-stop route to make the game believe you’re moving around, or even use the jump-teleport mode to “transfer” to a more resource-rich location. However, be careful with the jump-teleport mode, as it can betray the fact that you’re using a location spoofer.</p><p>To get started with Wondershare Dr.Fone and complete your field research tasks, you must follow a few steps:</p><ol><li>Download and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer;</li><li>Connect your phone to your computer;</li><li>Go to <strong>Toolbox &gt; Virtual Location &gt; Get Started</strong>;</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="get started with wondershare dr.fone"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>On the map that shows up, click on <strong>No Device</strong>in the upper right-hand corner;</li><li>You’ll see a list of all connected devices, select your phone;</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-1.png"                      alt="choose the Apple iPhone 13 device you want to connect to dr.fone"                ></p><ol start="6"><li>On your phone, tap <strong>Allow USB Debugging</strong>;</li><li>On your phone, go to <strong>Developer Options&gt; Select mock location app</strong>;</li><li>Select <strong>Fone</strong>.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-3.png"                      alt="set up mock location on your phone"                ></p><p>From there, you can easily set up your route, change your location, and simulate movement.

Pokémon Go is a very active game with frequent high-rewarding events that could happen at any time. Since these events are time-limited, you’ll always want to know precisely when they start and end.</p><p>Fortunately, finding this out is pretty easy. Just keep track of Pokémon Go on social media or visit the official Pokémon Go website to find out more. All events will be announced ahead of time so that you can prepare.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Acquiring Sun Stones for Pokémon evolutions can be quite a hassle.

Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and Launch the Application</strong></strong></p><p>At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to the system using a working cable and trust the system. On the interface of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), just agree to its terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Enter the Details of the Target Location</strong></strong></p><p>Once your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max is detected by the interface, its present location would be displayed with other details. To spoof the location of your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max on Pokemon Go, you can click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Now, you can go to the search options on the top-left side and enter the address or exact coordinates of the Pokestop. You can find the location of a Pokestop from several freely available online sources.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max Location to a Pokemon stop</strong></strong></p><p>As you would enter the location, the interface will automatically change to the designated spot. You can now move the pin around on the map and even zoom in&#x2F;out to drop it at the exact spot. In the end, just click on the “Move Here” button to spoof your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max’s location and visit the Pokemon stop virtually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Besides that, you can also use the one-stop or multi-stop modes of the application to simulate your movement and visit the nearby Pokemon Go stops.</p><p>I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to know about Poke stops in Pokemon Go. I have included several tips that I implement to find Pokemon stops near me in this guide. Though, if you want to catch more Pokemons via Pokemon Go stops, then you can simply use Lure Modules. Apart from that, you can also use a dedicated location spoofer like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) to visit Pokemon stops anywhere in the world and replenish unlimited items without any trouble.</p><h2 id="Hacks-to-do-pokemon-go-trainer-battles-For-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Max"><a href="#Hacks-to-do-pokemon-go-trainer-battles-For-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="Hacks to do pokemon go trainer battles For Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max"></a>Hacks to do pokemon go trainer battles For Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max</h2><p>With the launch of the Pokémon Go battle league, the trainer battles are seen as one of the options that can be used to compete and do it the hard way. As the name suggests it is a feature in Pokémon Go that lets you battle as a trainer against the other trainers. Pokémon Go trainer battles are a great way to enhance your skills as the rules are different from the gym and raid battles which are also a great feature of this game. The Pokémon CP limits are granted to each league from which the trainer needs to choose one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 1"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Point-of-Trainer-Battles-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Point-of-Trainer-Battles-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the Point of Trainer Battles in Pokémon Go?"></a>Part 1: What is the Point of Trainer Battles in Pokémon Go?</h2><p>The best part is that the teams are assembled by the trainers themselves. The point of the trainer battles is that a winning team is chosen while competing with the other players. The trainer battles Pokémon Go also lets the trainers choose the best players that would charge and power up Pokémon. Different spoils are embedded within the trainer battles and they all are worth trying. Once the trainer battles he is rewarded three times per day as a normal team leader. As an AI team leader, you can get the reward once every day.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 2"                ></p><p>Now you want to make sure that the charged attacks are learned and how they can be used as a weapon against the other players. The Pokémon should also be chosen as per the ability as different Pokémon have different charged attack ability overall. The Pokémon is of a different kind as all benefit from the charge attack in different states. It also means that you get to choose Pokémon like Tyranitar which will get you to through the battle with highly advanced skills. Typhlosion is a dual-type Pokémon and the raids which are done using it benefit the trainers as compared to single types.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-can-you-get-from-trainer-battles-Pokemon-go"><a href="#Part-2-What-can-you-get-from-trainer-battles-Pokemon-go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?"></a>Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?</h2><p>This part will deal with the rewards which the trainers will get for the battles which they will fight. There are three different types of rewards that you can win when it comes to trainer battles. These are as follows:</p><ul><li>Stardust</li><li>As of January 2019, the Rare Candy reward has also been introduced to make the battles more enchanting.</li><li>1 in 7 chance of Sinnoh Stone.</li></ul><p>No matter that you win or lose a battle these rewards are credited to your account. If you are playing with a computer the threshold to get the rewards is 1. If you are competing with the other players then the rewards can be earned thrice per day.

The CP stands for combat power and it means the power of your Pokémon. As a trainer when you battle more and more the XP increases and the CP as well. This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pokémon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pokémon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pokémon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pokémon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pokémon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pokémon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you. Use candies and power up your Pokémon to a higher level. It will also ensure that you get the best results on the battlefield. The weight and the size of the Pokémon also affect the CP score so you need a Pokémon that is both agile and lightweight to get the best results.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Tips-to-level-up-Pokemon-before-doing-the-Pokemon-go-trainer-battles"><a href="#Part-4-Tips-to-level-up-Pokemon-before-doing-the-Pokemon-go-trainer-battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Tips to level up Pokémon before doing the Pokémon go trainer battles"></a>Part 4: Tips to level up Pokémon before doing the Pokémon go trainer battles</h2><p>To get the best out of Pokémon Go battle another trainer it is advised to get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Here’s-Everything-You-Should-Know-About-Pokemon-Stops-in-Detail-On-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro"><a href="#Here’s-Everything-You-Should-Know-About-Pokemon-Stops-in-Detail-On-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Here’s Everything You Should Know About Pokemon Stops in Detail On Apple iPhone 12 Pro"></a>Here’s Everything You Should Know About Pokemon Stops in Detail On Apple iPhone 12 Pro</h2><p>If you are just starting with Pokemon Go, then you might see Pokemon stops all around you! Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it!

If you own an Android device, then you can simply use a GPS spoofing app to manually change the location of your device. This will trick Pokemon Go into believing that you are walking instead. For iPhone users, the feature would need a jailbroken device though.</p><p>While changing your location, make sure that you do it tactfully. For instance, if an egg would need 10 kilometers of walking, then change your location gradually instead of just switching it in one go. Here’s <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong> by using a GPS spoofer.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, unlock your Android phone and go to its Settings &gt; About Phone to tap the Build Number field 7 times. This will unlock the Developer Options settings on your Android.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock the Developer Options settings"                ></p></li><li><p>Now, go to the Play Store and install a reliable location spoofing app on your phone. Later, visit Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn it on. Also, allow mock locations on the phone and choose the installed app from here.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-3.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing app"                ></p></li><li><p>That’s it! Now you can just launch the fake GPS app and manually change your location to a few meters away to trick Pokemon Go. Do the same a few times to cover a prominent distance.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-4.jpg"                      alt="change your location to a few meters away"                ></p></li></ol><p>Just be sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect that you are using a GPS spoofer to hatch eggs.

Most of the eggs in Pokemon Go would need you to walk 2, 5, or 10 kilometers. The good news is that an average drone can easily cover this distance. Firstly, get a working drone on which you can easily place your phone. It is recommended to get a lock so that your device won’t fall while it is on a drone. Once your phone is successfully attached to a drone, just use it to cover a substantial distance. Make sure that the speed is minimal so that Pokemon Go would believe that you are walking instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-5.jpg"                      alt="Play Pokemon Go with a drone"                ></p><p><strong>Things to Remember</strong></p><ul><li>While doing so, don’t forget about the safety of your phone as it can get stolen by someone if it goes too far.</li><li>Use a lock and make sure that your phone won’t fall from your drone.</li><li>Enable the Find My Apple iPhone 12 Pro service on your Android or iPhone so that you can locate your phone if it is lost.</li><li>Move your drone slowly so that Pokemon Go would not detect that you are using a drone or playing the game while driving.</li></ul><h2 id="Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users"><a href="#Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users" class="headerlink" title="Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users"></a>Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users</h2><p>A while back, Pokemon Go enabled the option to add friends on the app and send them gifts. Presently, we can send gifts to 20 other friends from our account in a day. Therefore, if you have a lot of friends, then you can send them eggs, including the exclusive 7 km egg. There are tons of online sources and forums for people to exchange their friend codes for Pokemon Go.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, Launch Pokemon Go on your phone and go to your profile.

Though, if you wish to learn how to hack eggs in Pokemon Go without moving, then consider getting some incubators. There are all kinds of incubators available in the game that can help you hatch eggs without walking much.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, make sure that you have enough Pokecoins with you. If not, launch the app and tap on the Pokeball from its home to visit its shop.</p></li><li><p>From here, you can buy as many Pokecoins as you want.

You can just place your phone carefully on your bike or skateboard and cover the needed distance to hatch more eggs. While you would still have to go out for this, the effort needed would be far less than walking.</p><p>Just make sure that you stay safe while riding your bike or skateboard. Don’t focus too much on catching new Pokemons. Instead, just cover the needed distance to hatch the egg. Also, ride your bike or skateboard slowly to make sure Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-10.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Bike or Skateboard"                ></p><h2 id="Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go"></a>Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you have a Roomba or any other robotic cleaner in the house, then you can also take its assistance to hack Pokemon Go eggs. All you got to do is place your phone on the Roomba and let it move around in your house. Since the robotic cleaner would move slowly, it will make Pokemon Go believe that you are walking instead. Just be sure that your phone will stay safe and protected. I would recommend placing it in a waterproof lock to further protect it from any wear and tear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-11.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Roomba"                ></p><h2 id="Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go"></a>Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you are already into model railroads, then you won’t face any issues playing Pokemon Go. It would be the replica of a big railroad with miniature trains. Simply place your phone on a miniature train and let it revolve around the railroad to cover the distance. Just keep your phone safe and regulate the speed of the train to make sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement. You would have to drive your train for a while to cover the distance, but you don’t have to walk to do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-12.jpg"                      alt="Model Railroad"                ></p><h2 id="Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go"></a>Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go</h2><p>Do you have a turntable?

Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 12 mini’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 12 mini and Launch the Application</strong></strong></p><p>At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 12 mini to the system using a working cable and trust the system. On the interface of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), just agree to its terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Enter the Details of the Target Location</strong></strong></p><p>Once your Apple iPhone 12 mini is detected by the interface, its present location would be displayed with other details. To spoof the location of your Apple iPhone 12 mini on Pokemon Go, you can click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Now, you can go to the search options on the top-left side and enter the address or exact coordinates of the Pokestop. You can find the location of a Pokestop from several freely available online sources.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone 12 mini Location to a Pokemon stop</strong></strong></p><p>As you would enter the location, the interface will automatically change to the designated spot. You can now move the pin around on the map and even zoom in&#x2F;out to drop it at the exact spot. In the end, just click on the “Move Here” button to spoof your Apple iPhone 12 mini’s location and visit the Pokemon stop virtually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Besides that, you can also use the one-stop or multi-stop modes of the application to simulate your movement and visit the nearby Pokemon Go stops.</p><p>I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to know about Poke stops in Pokemon Go. I have included several tips that I implement to find Pokemon stops near me in this guide. Though, if you want to catch more Pokemons via Pokemon Go stops, then you can simply use Lure Modules. Apart from that, you can also use a dedicated location spoofer like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) to visit Pokemon stops anywhere in the world and replenish unlimited items without any trouble.</p><h2 id="What-is-the-best-Pokemon-for-pokemon-pvp-ranking-On-Apple-iPhone-12-mini"><a href="#What-is-the-best-Pokemon-for-pokemon-pvp-ranking-On-Apple-iPhone-12-mini" class="headerlink" title="What is the best Pokemon for pokemon pvp ranking On Apple iPhone 12 mini?"></a>What is the best Pokemon for pokemon pvp ranking On Apple iPhone 12 mini?</h2><p>Many people play Pokemon Go to have fun and spend quality leisure time.

What is the Pokemon Go PvP Rank Game?"></a>Part 1. What is the Pokemon Go PvP Rank Game?</h2><p>When talking about Pokemon Go, the first thing that usually comes to mind is Pokemon hunting and spinning PokeStops. Well, it’s true to a certain degree. Your main goal as a trainer is to build large Pokemon collections and obtain as many rewards as you can. However, there’s actually more to it. Players are also given the option to increase their ranking by battling another trainer. Yes. That is called the Pokemon Go PvP rank game.</p><p>Pokemon Go PvP rank battles are far different from other forms of duel in the game. Why so? The simplest explanation is that your opponent in PvP is a real human trainer, not a pre-mediated computer program. That’s why you may expect that winning on this battlefield is not going to be a smooth ride. You have to gear up your gaming skills very well and prepare a competent strategy to bring home victory.

Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 12’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 12 and Launch the Application</strong></strong></p><p>At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 12 to the system using a working cable and trust the system. On the interface of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), just agree to its terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Enter the Details of the Target Location</strong></strong></p><p>Once your Apple iPhone 12 is detected by the interface, its present location would be displayed with other details. To spoof the location of your Apple iPhone 12 on Pokemon Go, you can click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Now, you can go to the search options on the top-left side and enter the address or exact coordinates of the Pokestop. You can find the location of a Pokestop from several freely available online sources.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone 12 Location to a Pokemon stop</strong></strong></p><p>As you would enter the location, the interface will automatically change to the designated spot. You can now move the pin around on the map and even zoom in&#x2F;out to drop it at the exact spot. In the end, just click on the “Move Here” button to spoof your Apple iPhone 12’s location and visit the Pokemon stop virtually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Besides that, you can also use the one-stop or multi-stop modes of the application to simulate your movement and visit the nearby Pokemon Go stops.</p><p>I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to know about Poke stops in Pokemon Go. I have included several tips that I implement to find Pokemon stops near me in this guide. Though, if you want to catch more Pokemons via Pokemon Go stops, then you can simply use Lure Modules. Apart from that, you can also use a dedicated location spoofer like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) to visit Pokemon stops anywhere in the world and replenish unlimited items without any trouble.</p><h2 id="Latest-way-to-get-Shiny-Meltan-Box-in-Pokemon-Go-Mystery-Box-On-Apple-iPhone-12"><a href="#Latest-way-to-get-Shiny-Meltan-Box-in-Pokemon-Go-Mystery-Box-On-Apple-iPhone-12" class="headerlink" title="Latest way to get Shiny Meltan Box in Pokémon Go Mystery Box On Apple iPhone 12"></a>Latest way to get Shiny Meltan Box in Pokémon Go Mystery Box On Apple iPhone 12</h2><p>The news of every Pokémon Go player being able to shift to Pokémon Home was taken in with a flavorsome acceptance from the community of trainers.

To receive a Mystery Box in the game, you should connect your Pokémon Go and Home accounts in the first place.

The mock location of Dr.Fone lets you simulate your position and permits your mobile application to presume that you have selected the application interface of Dr.Fone without any restrain or recognition from developers of Pokémon Go. Follow the instructions below to catch Pokémon any place without making any movement.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install:</strong></p><p>Install the ‘Dr. Fone toolkit’ from the official website after downloading it. After installation, launch the toolkit and select the ‘Virtual Location’ tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Connect:</strong></p><p>Subsequently, connect your PC or laptop with the Dr. Fone application. Also, permit the location services to retrieve the location of your device. Then, press on the ‘Get Started’ button to use the services of Dr. Fone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Imitate your GPS position:</strong></p><p>Select your current location on the map. Next, click the leftmost button on the top-right corner of the window to start the ‘Teleport’ mode. Then search the places you wish to mock your position with, and press ‘Go’ after the selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="virtual location 8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Imitate Movement between steps:</strong></p><p>To start the simulation, make a movement and traverse to the ‘Move Here’ button to reach multiple times. By default, the motion is adjusted to ‘1’, but it can be replaced by the user to switch the program correspondingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="virtual location 9"                ></p><p>The simulated position will emerge as genuine for the Pokémon Go app, and it will believe that you are moving between the two designated positions chosen on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the motion speed can also be tuned using the sliding menu. This way, you can use the false maneuver of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without having the need to understand it. Also, your application will not be banned.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="virtual location 10"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="virtual location 11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:</strong></p><p>Dr. Fone’s application also permits you to replicate activity between more than two sites. The component is called after the multi-stop path that can be chosen from the GUI toolbox class positioned at the top-right nook that lets you put numerous specified destinations on the map, and your position will behave appropriately as controlled by the virtual location application of Dr.Fone.</p><p>To grant permission to the system to mock movement by picking out the right options, press the ‘March’ button.

Specify the number of trips and speed settings. Initiate the process by clicking on “Start Moving.” During the simulation, you can “Pause” the sequence at any point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="begin moving with multi-route stop"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, the pursuit of capturing a <strong>Snorlax Pokémon sleeping</strong> in Pokémon GO is an ever-evolving adventure.

On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop.

Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much.

The good news is that the Pokémon company is very responsive to preventing and combating such attacks. Cooldown Pokémon go another such feature to deter cheating. So let us discuss what cooldown means.</p><p>What is a cooldown? Cooldown Time restricts to stop a player from repeating multiple actions at different locations in a specified period.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-does-Soft-Banned-Cooldown-Mean"><a href="#Part-1-What-does-Soft-Banned-Cooldown-Mean" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What does Soft Banned &amp; Cooldown Mean?"></a>Part 1: What does Soft Banned &amp; Cooldown Mean?</h2><p>A soft ban is a restriction to discourage people from playing Pokémon Go while driving or moving. The three primary reasons for getting a soft ban are GPS spoofing, sharing accounts, and traveling fast. A soft ban is a temporary ban triggered when the Pokémon determines that the player cannot arrive within a period. So how do you know if you’re soft-banned Pokémon go? A soft ban has some consequences, i.e., wasting tickets, no Pokémon guarding towers, no attacking Pokémon defending towers, etc.</p><p>What does cool down mean? Cooldown is the time a player has to wait after completing the in-game action. It is calculated from the distance you travel between the triggering activities. It depends on distance travel, and the time for cooldown is also high when the distance is high.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Happens-When-You-Get-a-Soft-Ban"><a href="#Part-2-What-Happens-When-You-Get-a-Soft-Ban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Happens When You Get a Soft Ban?"></a>Part 2: What Happens When You Get a Soft Ban?</h2><p>When you get a soft ban, its duration is about 12 hours. In this period, any Pokémon you catch during the ban period will leave even if you use any ball type or berries. It also restricts you from winning gym fights and looting Pokéstops. You can still keep playing Pokémon, though, as it is the most lenient form of ban.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Cooldown-Rules-and-How-to-Avoid-Soft-Ban-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-3-Cooldown-Rules-and-How-to-Avoid-Soft-Ban-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Cooldown Rules and How to Avoid Soft Ban in Pokémon Go?"></a>Part 3: Cooldown Rules and How to Avoid Soft Ban in Pokémon Go?</h2><h3 id="1-How-long-does-it-take-for-a-Pokemon-to-Cool-Down"><a href="#1-How-long-does-it-take-for-a-Pokemon-to-Cool-Down" class="headerlink" title="1.

Try the One-Route Function for Destination Location</li></ul><p>To use this feature, navigate to the upper-right section and tap the “One-Stop Route” icon. It is denoted by the third icon from the left. As you’ve already been teleported to a different location, simply tap on any point on the map to designate it as your destination.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="navigate one-stop route option"                ></p><ul><li>Step 5. Adjust and Start Simulation Parameters</li></ul><p>Upon selecting, decide whether you want a “Round Trip” or “Loop Trip,” and enter the number of times you want the trip. Now, drag the slider to choose the speed of spoofing and proceed by tapping on the “Move Here” button. Afterward, the simulation will start, so you can witness your movement now. To hold the simulation, click the “Pause” or “Clear” buttons to stop or return to the actual location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="set route parameters to start moving"                ></p><ul><li>Step 6. Initiate Multi-Sop Route and Define Parameters</li></ul><p>If you want to move between multi-routes, activate the “Multi-Stop Route” feature from the top-right side and set multiple stops on the map. You should first define the number of trips or speeds and press “Start Moving” for further processing. As the process starts, hit the “Pause” where you want to hold the simulation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png"                      alt="set multiple routes on dr.fone"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>To wrap up, Pokémon GO PvP leagues excitedly produce rewards and rankings.

As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 11 Pro’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro and Launch the Application</strong></strong></p><p>At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to the system using a working cable and trust the system.

Like all other games, the publisher always tries their best to make the user experience more enriching and fair for the users.</p><p>Season 1 of the Battle League’s had a severe bug that a handful of players exploited to rise to the leader board. After a player has lodged few fast moves, (number of fast moves required for each Pokémon to charge attack, varies) the trainer’s Pokémon can lodge a secondary yet stronger charged attack to deal more damage.</p><p>The bug in the series implied that a Pokémon – “Melmetal” is able to recharge their charge attack even while attacking with a “Charged” move, essentially making the trainer using the Pokémon invincible during a real battle.</p><p>Several trainers immediately tweeted this excruciating bug to Niantic requesting this issue to be resolved immediately, as a result Niantic had to freeze the leader board for that season.</p><p>Players when entering the Battle League are shown – Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available Right Now, and all matches that were in progress were not concluded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-1.jpg"                      alt="pokemon 1"                ></p><p>Thankfully, the issue has been resolved and trainers can get back into the league without any change in the previous features.</p><p>Here’s a set of few known issues in the game currently being investigated by Niantic, which we can hope to see resolved later on in the future;</p><ul><li><strong>Inconsistent Fast Attacks against Opponent Charged Attacks –</strong> Your fast attacks don’t land a direct hit when the opponent is throwing his Charged Attack.</li><li><strong>Fast Attacks are slower on Android –</strong> Most android users are experiencing slower fast attacks than iOS users.

Here are some of the tips that you can follow to level-up in the game easily.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Have-a-Balanced-Team"><a href="#Tip-1-Have-a-Balanced-Team" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Have a Balanced Team"></a>Tip 1: Have a Balanced Team</h3><p>Most of the rookie PvP trainers make the common mistake of only picking attack-based Pokemons with fewer defense stats. Try not to make this mistake and have a balanced team in which you have both attacking and defensive Pokemons. Also, try to get Pokemons of different types to counter your opponent’s picks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-pvp-battle.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go pvp battle"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-2-Know-the-Current-Meta-Tier"><a href="#Tip-2-Know-the-Current-Meta-Tier" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Know the Current Meta Tier"></a>Tip 2: Know the Current Meta Tier</h3><p>Just like any other PvP game, Pokemon Go Battle Leagues also has a tier-list. That is, some Pokemons are just more powerful than others. Therefore, before you pick your Pokemons, get to know about the current meta-list. This will help you pick more powerful Pokemons that can easily carry a game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/meta-pokemons-in-pvp.jpg"                      alt="meta pokemons in pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Catch-More-Pokemons-Easily"><a href="#Tip-3-Catch-More-Pokemons-Easily" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Catch More Pokemons Easily"></a>Tip 3: Catch More Pokemons Easily</h3><p>Since it is not feasible to step out and look for Pokemons, you can use a location spoofer tool instead.

Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 11’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 11 and Launch the Application</strong></strong></p><p>At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 11 to the system using a working cable and trust the system.

Sadly, players can’t explore their surroundings or travel to play the game all the time. That’s why they often take the assistance of a Pokemon Go joystick. While Pokemon joysticks are extremely popular, they have some downfalls as well if you don’t pick the right tool. Therefore, in this post, I will list the risks and benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick hack to help you make up your mind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Joystick Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Pokemon-Go-Joystick-101-Things-to-Know"><a href="#Part-1-Pokemon-Go-Joystick-101-Things-to-Know" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Pokemon Go Joystick 101: Things to Know"></a><strong>Part 1: Pokemon Go Joystick 101: Things to Know</strong></h2><p>Before we get into the details, it is important to know the basics of this fake GPS Pokemon Go hack. Ideally, Pokemon Go joysticks are dedicated mobile or desktop applications that let us simulate the movement of our device. In most of the spoofing tools for Pokemon Go, the following features are offered.</p><ul><li>Users can directly spoof their location on Pokemon Go to anywhere they like in the world.</li><li>They can also simulate the movement of their device (and the trainer) using the inbuilt joystick.</li><li>The Pokemon Go Joystick APK can also let you set up a preferred speed for walking, jogging, or running.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Joystick"                ></p><p>Therefore, with the help of a Pokemon Go hack APK like this, players don’t have to leave their house to catch Pokemons. They can also participate in raids to hatch eggs from the comfort of their home.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Playing-Pokemon-Go-with-a-Joystick"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Playing-Pokemon-Go-with-a-Joystick" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?"></a><strong>Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?</strong></h2><p>There are several reasons why Pokemon Go joystick iOS&#x2F;Android hacks are so popular. After all, they give us the convenience to play our favorite game without breaking a sweat. Here are some of the major reasons why Pokemon Go joystick hacks are becoming so popular:</p><ul><li><p>Stay Safe Indoors</p><p>  Since we are in the middle of a global pandemic, it is not recommended to go out to explore Pokemons. Besides that, your neighborhood might not be safe or there could be unfavorable weather conditions outside. Therefore, you can consider using a Pokemon Go joystick to catch Pokemons without compromising your safety.</p></li><li><p>Move Beyond your Area</p><p>  If you are in a rural area, then chances are that there could be limited spawning locations for Pokemons. With a fake GPS Pokemon Go app, you can spoof your location to any major city.</p></li><li><p>Catch More Pokemons</p><p>  One of the major benefits of using a Pokemon Go spoofer APK is that we can easily catch tons of Pokemons without exploring any area. Just enter the exact spawning location of the Pokemon and catch it!</p></li><li><p>Level-up in the Game Easily</p><p>  From participating in raids to hatching eggs faster, there are so many other things that you can do with a Pokemon Go joystick.</p></li><li><p>Have a Better Gaming Experience</p><p>  Overall, a Pokemon Go spoofing iOS&#x2F;Android solution will provide tons of add-on features that would improve your gaming experience.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-What-are-the-Risks-of-Using-Pokemon-Go-Joysticks"><a href="#Part-3-What-are-the-Risks-of-Using-Pokemon-Go-Joysticks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?"></a><strong>Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?</strong></h2><p>While there are numerous benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick, its constant use can also backfire in the long run.</p><ul><li><p>Account Ban by Niantic</p><p>  Ideally, you should know that the use of any third-party service (like a fake GPS Pokemon Go hack) is against the terms and conditions of the game. At first, if Niantic will detect its use, then it will simply display a warning message. Though, after several warning messages, if your account is still flagged, then it can get permanently banned.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-3.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Account Ban"                ></p><p>  To avoid the banning of your Pokemon Go account, you can consider a “cooldown duration”. This simply suggests waiting for a specific duration before changing your location in the game.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-4.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Cooldown Duration"                ></p></li><li><p>Software Hack on Jailbroken Devices</p><p>  To use a Pokemon Go joystick iOS hack, you might have to jailbreak your device. This can even null the warranty of your device and would make it susceptible to security threats. You might already know that a jailbroken device can easily be corrupted by the spoofer or any other app.</p></li><li><p>The Pokemon Go Spoofing Company Might Shut Down</p><p>  Chances are that the Pokemon Go spoofing solution that you have purchased might go out of business. For instance, iSpoofer (an iOS fake GPS tool) is no longer functioning and its existing users can’t even reach out to its customer support after getting their account banned. That’s why it is highly recommended to only pick a reliable Pokemon Go joystick solution.</p></li></ul><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>As you can see, picking a reliable Pokemon Go joystick is the most important thing to play the game remotely.
