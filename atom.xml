Completing your Pokedex requires a lot of traveling to specific parts of the globe, trading with players who have been there, or waiting for Pokemon GO’s special events.</p><p>Alternatively, players can use virtual location-changing tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone, and today, we’ll show you how to catch all <strong>Pokemon GO regional exclusives</strong> with this easy-to-use app.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Regional-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Regional-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Keeping track of it all can be challenging, and that’s why we’ve created a detailed information table with regions and specific Pokemon GO regional exclusives you can find in each.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Region</strong></th><th><strong>Pokemon</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>Africa</em></td><td>Corsola, Lunatone, Solrock, Tropius, Shellos, Pansear, Throh, Basculin, Sigilyph, Durant, Vivillon, Red Flabebe, Furfrou Trim, Oricorio, Kartana, Celesteela</td></tr><tr><td><em>Asia</em></td><td>Farfetch’d, Corsola, Volbeat, Torkoal, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Pachirisu, Chatot, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmor, Vivillon, Fabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana Celesteela</td></tr><tr><td><em>Australia</em></td><td>Kangaskhan, Corsola, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Chatot, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmor, Vivillon, Celesteela</td></tr><tr><td><em>Europe</em></td><td>Mr. Mime, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Solrock, Tropius, Shellos, Mime Jr., Pansear, Sawk, Basculin, Sigilyph, Heatmor, Vivillon, Klefki, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana</td></tr><tr><td><em>Middle East</em></td><td>Corsola, Tropius, Lunatone, Shellos, Pansear, Basculin, Sawk, Sigilyph, Durant, Vivillon, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana</td></tr><tr><td><em>New Zealand</em></td><td>Chatot, Relicanth, Shellos, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmore, Vivillon, Celesteela</td></tr><tr><td><em>North America</em></td><td>Tauros, Heracross, Illumise, Seviper, Solrock, Pachirisu, Shellos, Carnivine, Panpour, Throh, Basculin, Maractus, Bouffalant, Durant, Vivillon, Flabebe, Furfrou, Hawlucha, Oricorio, Comfey, Kartana</td></tr><tr><td><em>South America</em></td><td>Heracross, Corsola, Illumise, Seviper, Solrock, Shellos, Chatot, Panpour, Throh, Basculin, Maractus, Durant, Vivillon, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Celesteela</td></tr></tbody></table><p>While they’re categorized as available on the entire continent, it’s worth noting that some Pokemon can only be found in particular regions like France or Russia.

Learning About the Regional Pokemon Distribution"></a>Part 4. Learning About the Regional Pokemon Distribution</h2><p>With almost 60 Pokemon GO regional exclusives in 2024, keeping track of where each creature spawns can be a nightmare, especially when some Pokemon can only be found in tiny and specific areas. However, you don’t necessarily have to remember the location of each regional Pokemon, as there are other ways of learning about their distribution.</p><h3 id="Getting-Information-From-the-Community"><a href="#Getting-Information-From-the-Community" class="headerlink" title="Getting Information From the Community"></a>Getting Information From the Community</h3><p>The primary method of acquiring information that most players rely on is keeping in touch with the Pokemon GO community. Players can follow Pokemon GO creators, watch YouTube news channels covering new releases, and join countless forums and social media pages dedicated to the game.</p><h3 id="Using-Official-Pokemon-Go-Announcements"><a href="#Using-Official-Pokemon-Go-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Using Official Pokemon Go Announcements"></a>Using Official Pokemon Go Announcements</h3><p>Official announcements are another way to learn more about Pokemon GO’s regional exclusives. Keeping track of these will help you track regional spawn points and special events. Enabling notifications from the game on your mobile device can also be particularly helpful in keeping track of announcements.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Quickly-Travel-to-Different-Regions"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Quickly-Travel-to-Different-Regions" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

How to Quickly Travel to Different Regions</h2><p>While regional Pokemon GO exclusives have brought novelties to Niantic’s viral AR game, they require a lot of traveling and trading, making it significantly more challenging for players to catch them all, which is the whole point of the game.</p><p>However, there’s also an alternative to traveling and trading, as countless virtual location-changing apps can help avid Pokemon GO players catch these exclusive beasts. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a fantastic example of such a tool, and with a quick setup and a few clicks, it can help players move without moving.</p><p>Using Dr.Fone to change your virtual location is remarkably straightforward and can be done in a few steps.

Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events"></a>Part 6. Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events</h2><p>While incredibly straightforward and helpful, changing your virtual location isn’t the only way you can go about catching Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures.</p><p>The game’s special events often remove regional Pokemon distribution restrictions, allowing exclusive creatures to spawn around the globe for a particular period. With these, you can find and catch Asia-specific Pokemon in North America and vice versa.</p><p>It’s worth noting that these special events are pretty rare in Pokemon GO. You’ll need to pay close attention to the game’s announcements, as you don’t want to miss an opportunity to add another, hard-to-find, regional Pokemon to your Pokedex.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Trading-Regional-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-7-Trading-Regional-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon"></a>Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon</h2><p>As mentioned above, trading regional Pokemon GO exclusives is another one of your options if you can’t or don’t want to travel. Players can find other users from around the globe and initiate Pokemon GO creature exchanges to complete their Pokedex with all the available regionals.</p><p>However, trading regional Pokemon can also be quite challenging as it requires finding users willing to swap their region-specific Pokemon for the ones you have. There’ll undoubtedly be situations where users might not want to give up a more valuable catch for the one in your region, making trading a less viable option than changing your virtual location.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Completing your Pokedex and becoming the ultimate Pokemon trainer in Niantic’s viral AR game can be particularly challenging due to Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures. To catch these, players must travel to regions where these Pokemon spawn, trade with other users who’ve visited these areas, or wait for the game’s special events to lift regional spawn restrictions.</p><p>Alternatively, Pokemon trainers can use GPS-spoofing apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone and its Virtual Location Changer feature to change their mobile device’s GPS location. This helpful feature lets players move without moving and travel to specific regional spawn points without physically going there.</p><h2 id="How-to-Fix-Pokemon-Go-Route-Not-Working-On-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022"><a href="#How-to-Fix-Pokemon-Go-Route-Not-Working-On-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix Pokemon Go Route Not Working On Apple iPhone SE (2022)?"></a>How to Fix Pokemon Go Route Not Working On Apple iPhone SE (2022)?</h2><p>Pokemon Go Routes has been here for quite some time now. By far, it’s still the favorite in-game feature of many trainers all around the world. The reason is pretty obvious.

On top of that, Pokemon Go Routes can also be of great help if you’re searching for new walking paths around your location. Simply put, this particular addition to the game’s already amazing roster has many real-life and virtual benefits for the players.</p><p>However, it’s perhaps safe to say that Pokemon Go Routes is still far from perfect. There have been a few complaints from users about <strong>Pokemon Go Route not working.</strong> While this issue is fairly common among the players, the root cause differs depending on the given situation.

First, you can record a walking path anywhere and submit it for review. Your Route will immediately appear on the Pokemon Go map once it receives approval from the game developer. Of course, the quality and safety of the Route must be checked thoroughly before it becomes available to the public. Another thing about the Route is that you can use it to discover and explore new walking paths near you. All you need to do is pick your preferred Route and finish the entire trail. Afterward, you can obtain special rewards and extra bonus points upon its completion.</p><p>Do you want to try Pokemon Go Routes now?

Professor Sycamore is going to upgrade your Mega Ring at the Anistar Sundial after defeating your opponent in Kiloude City. It’s not possible after you complete the main story.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In order to perform a Mega Evolution, the Pokémon needs to hold a special Mega Stone.

Your Pokémon will remain in its Mega form until the fight is complete or it faints.</p><p>That’s how to evolve into Mega Mewtwo. As you can now see that the first and most important step is to beat Korrina in order to mega evolve.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Is-Mega-Mewtwo-Worth"><a href="#Part-3-What-Is-Mega-Mewtwo-Worth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Is Mega Mewtwo Worth?"></a>Part 3: What Is Mega Mewtwo Worth?</h2><p>No other Pokémon is as all-powerful, immortal, and invincible as the Mewtwo from series of Pokémon.

Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events</h2><p>While incredibly straightforward and helpful, changing your virtual location isn’t the only way you can go about catching Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures.</p><p>The game’s special events often remove regional Pokemon distribution restrictions, allowing exclusive creatures to spawn around the globe for a particular period. With these, you can find and catch Asia-specific Pokemon in North America and vice versa.</p><p>It’s worth noting that these special events are pretty rare in Pokemon GO. You’ll need to pay close attention to the game’s announcements, as you don’t want to miss an opportunity to add another, hard-to-find, regional Pokemon to your Pokedex.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Trading-Regional-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-7-Trading-Regional-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 7.

Players can find other users from around the globe and initiate Pokemon GO creature exchanges to complete their Pokedex with all the available regionals.</p><p>However, trading regional Pokemon can also be quite challenging as it requires finding users willing to swap their region-specific Pokemon for the ones you have. There’ll undoubtedly be situations where users might not want to give up a more valuable catch for the one in your region, making trading a less viable option than changing your virtual location.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Completing your Pokedex and becoming the ultimate Pokemon trainer in Niantic’s viral AR game can be particularly challenging due to Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures. To catch these, players must travel to regions where these Pokemon spawn, trade with other users who’ve visited these areas, or wait for the game’s special events to lift regional spawn restrictions.</p><p>Alternatively, Pokemon trainers can use GPS-spoofing apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone and its Virtual Location Changer feature to change their mobile device’s GPS location. This helpful feature lets players move without moving and travel to specific regional spawn points without physically going there.</p><h2 id="Best-Pokemons-for-PVP-Matches-in-Pokemon-Go-For-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max"><a href="#Best-Pokemons-for-PVP-Matches-in-Pokemon-Go-For-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max" class="headerlink" title="Best Pokemons for PVP Matches in Pokemon Go For Apple iPhone XS Max"></a>Best Pokemons for PVP Matches in Pokemon Go For Apple iPhone XS Max</h2><p>We all know how much fun Pokémon GO has been, where we get out and catch Pokémon through battle. However, a much more interesting factor is PvP battles, where you can go head-to-head with other trainers. In this article, we are going to talk about why adding PvP battles is not just something we want but something we really need.</p><p>PvP battles are important for making the game more exciting and having some friendly competition.

What Are the Possible Leagues in Pokémon GO PvP</h2><p>There are three core leagues in the trainer battles in Pokémon GO, namely Great, Ultra, and Master. Each of these leagues has its own CP limitation and comes in rotation during each season. So, you have to learn to battle in each of them to get seamless rewards. Let’s look at each of these leagues individually for a better understanding of the <strong>best Pokémon for PvP</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/everything-to-know-about-pvp-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon pvp battles"                ></p><h3 id="1-Great-League"><a href="#1-Great-League" class="headerlink" title="1. Great League"></a>1. Great League</h3><p>The Great League is the easiest league to jump into for beginners. Here, only Pokémon with 1,500 CP or less can join the battle. This low CP cap makes Pokémon with lower maximum CP shine, like Azumarill and Altaria. These Pokémon might not stand out in the other leagues, but in the Great League, they can dominate the battlefield.</p><h3 id="2-Ultra-League"><a href="#2-Ultra-League" class="headerlink" title="2. Ultra League"></a>2. Ultra League</h3><p>The next league that comes is Ultra League, which raises the CP cap to 2,500. Legendary Pokémon start making appearances here, with a focus on defensive power. Pokémon like Registeel and Cresselia excel in this league, but there are also many other Pokémon that hold their own valuable potential.</p><p>In the same way, Venusaur with Frenzy Plant and Swampert with Hydro Cannon are also popular choices in this league.</p><h3 id="3-Master-League"><a href="#3-Master-League" class="headerlink" title="3. Master League"></a>3. Master League</h3><p>The Master League removes all CP limits, allowing any Pokémon to jump into the action. Here, Trainers tend to lean towards Pokémon with high maximum CP. Pokémon like Groudon and Origin Forme Giratina are notable here, making them fit for any kind of battle.</p><p>Surprisingly, some Pokémon are not commonly picked for Raids, like Dialga and Altered Forme Giratina. However, they are powerful competitors and key contributors to the Master League.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Strongest-Pokemon-To-Use-in-Each-Pokemon-GO-PvP-League"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Strongest-Pokemon-To-Use-in-Each-Pokemon-GO-PvP-League" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Then click on “get started”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Connect Device</strong></p><p>Now, you need to take your Apple iPhone 13 mini’s cable and use it to connect your Apple iPhone 13 mini to the PC. Wait until the program detects it. Maybe you need to trust the PC if you are plugging the Apple iPhone 13 mini device for the first time.</p><p><strong>Step 3: See your Location</strong></p><p>Now on the interface, you’d see a map with your location highlighted on it. If your location is incorrectly displayed then click on the “center on” option. Now the location displayed would be accurate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="virtual location 03"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Activate Teleport Mode</strong></p><p>Subsequently, activate the “teleport mode” by clicking the icon shown in the image.

These pokemon are very rare to find and hence you won’t want to trade these rare Pokemons very often, however, you can trade a rare Pokemon only once per day. To trade a rare Pokemon would also need to be a Great or Best friend, two of the highest levels of friendship in the game Pokemon go. To increase your friendship level you need to battle and trade more and more. It’ll take quite a bit of time to reach that stature of a friendship level. This could cost as much as one million, this amount will however decrease with increasing friendship levels.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983475">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983475.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983475">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983475.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983475%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983475/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Trading in Pokemon go was introduced in recent times and had now become one of the most integral factors of the game.

Different spoils are embedded within the trainer battles and they all are worth trying. Once the trainer battles he is rewarded three times per day as a normal team leader.

The Pokémon should also be chosen as per the ability as different Pokémon have different charged attack ability overall. The Pokémon is of a different kind as all benefit from the charge attack in different states. It also means that you get to choose Pokémon like Tyranitar which will get you to through the battle with highly advanced skills. Typhlosion is a dual-type Pokémon and the raids which are done using it benefit the trainers as compared to single types.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-can-you-get-from-trainer-battles-Pokemon-go"><a href="#Part-2-What-can-you-get-from-trainer-battles-Pokemon-go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?"></a>Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?</h2><p>This part will deal with the rewards which the trainers will get for the battles which they will fight.

The CP stands for combat power and it means the power of your Pokémon. As a trainer when you battle more and more the XP increases and the CP as well. This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pokémon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pokémon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pokémon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pokémon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pokémon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pokémon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you.

These pokemon are very rare to find and hence you won’t want to trade these rare Pokemons very often, however, you can trade a rare Pokemon only once per day. To trade a rare Pokemon would also need to be a Great or Best friend, two of the highest levels of friendship in the game Pokemon go. To increase your friendship level you need to battle and trade more and more. It’ll take quite a bit of time to reach that stature of a friendship level. This could cost as much as one million, this amount will however decrease with increasing friendship levels.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Trading in Pokemon go was introduced in recent times and had now become one of the most integral factors of the game.

To win more matches and rank-up, players take the assistance of a Pokemon Go PvP tier list.

In this post, I’m going to share dedicated Pokemon Go great, ultra, and master tier lists to help you pick the best Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-pvp-tier-list-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go pvp tier list banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-are-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-Lists-Evaluated"><a href="#Part-1-How-are-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-Lists-Evaluated" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How are Pokemon Go PvP Tier Lists Evaluated?"></a>Part 1: How are Pokemon Go PvP Tier Lists Evaluated?</h2><p>Before you go through our carefully calculated great, ultra, and master league Pokemon Go tier list, you should know some basics. Ideally, the following parameters are considered while placing any Pokemon in a tier list.</p><p><strong>Moves:</strong> The most important factor is the amount of damage any move can do. For instance, some moves like thunderbolt are more powerful than others.</p><p><strong>Pokemon type:</strong> The type of Pokemon also plays a vital role. You might already know that some Pokemon types can easily be countered while others have fewer counters.</p><p><strong>Updates:</strong> Niantic keeps updating Pokemon levels to have a balanced Pokemon Go PvP tier list. That’s why the current nerf or buff on any Pokemon would change their position in the list.</p><p><strong>CP levels:</strong> Since the three leagues have CP limits, the overall CP value of any Pokemon is also vital to place them in a tier list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-levels-pokemon-leagues.jpg"                      alt="cp levels pokemon leagues"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087485/7443" target="_top" id="2087485">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087485" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087485/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-A-Complete-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-List-Great-Ultra-and-Master-Leagues"><a href="#Part-2-A-Complete-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-List-Great-Ultra-and-Master-Leagues" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Complete Pokemon Go PvP Tier List: Great, Ultra, and Master Leagues"></a>Part 2: A Complete Pokemon Go PvP Tier List: Great, Ultra, and Master Leagues</h2><p>Since Pokemon Go PvP matches are based on different leagues, I have also come up with Pokemon ultra, great, and master league tier lists to help you pick the most powerful Pokemon in every match.</p><h3 id="Pokemon-Go-Great-League-Tier-List"><a href="#Pokemon-Go-Great-League-Tier-List" class="headerlink" title="Pokemon Go Great League Tier List"></a>Pokemon Go Great League Tier List</h3><p>In Great League matches, the maximum CP of any Pokemon can be 1500.

Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.</p><h3 id="Why-did-iSpoofer-shutdown"><a href="#Why-did-iSpoofer-shutdown" class="headerlink" title="Why did iSpoofer shutdown?"></a>Why did iSpoofer shutdown?</h3><ul><li>The use of iSpoofer for Pokemon Go is against the terms of the game (as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party apps).</li><li>Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.</li><li>Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.</li><li>Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-go-account-warning.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go account warning"                ></p><h3 id="Will-iSpoofer-work-again"><a href="#Will-iSpoofer-work-again" class="headerlink" title="Will iSpoofer work again?"></a>Will iSpoofer work again?</h3><p>Most likely, the chances of iSpoofer working again are pretty bleak. This is because Pokemon Go users were the major target customers of the product. Since Niantic has blocklisted iSpoofer a while back, Pokemon Go players can no longer use it. Therefore, it is better to look for a reliable iSpoofer alternative instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-not-working.jpg"                      alt="ispoofer not working"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135369/19272" target="_top" id="2135369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135369/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135356/19272" target="_top" id="2135356">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135356" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135356/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-The-Best-iSpoofer-Alternative-to-Change-your-Apple-iPhone-6s-Location"><a href="#Part-2-The-Best-iSpoofer-Alternative-to-Change-your-Apple-iPhone-6s-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Change your Apple iPhone 6s Location"></a>Part 2: The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Change your Apple iPhone 6s Location</h2><p>If you are looking for an iSpoofer alternative to spoof your phone location, consider picking <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS &amp; Android) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

This is because Google allows us to mock the location of our device using any reliable mobile app (unlike Apple). Therefore, if you are looking for an iSpoofer alternative for Android devices, you can follow these basic instructions.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Enable the Mock Location feature</strong></p><p>At first, you need to turn on the Developer Options to enable the Mock Location feature. For this, go to your phone’s Settings &gt; About Phone and tap the “Build Number” seven times to turn on Developer Options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/enable-developer-options.jpg"                      alt="enable developer options"                ></p><p>Great! Now you can go to your phone’s Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn on the Mock Location option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/allow-mock-locations.jpg"                      alt="allow mock locations"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Install a Mock Location App</strong></p><p>Afterward, you can go to the Play Store and install any reliable mock location app from developers like Hola or Lexa. Let’s suppose we have installed the Mock GPS app by Lexa on the Apple iPhone 6s device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-gps-lexa.jpg"                      alt="fake gps lexa"                ></p><p>Once the app has been downloaded, you can again go to your phone’s Settings &gt; Developer Options and set the app as a default tool to spoof your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-mock-location-app.jpg"                      alt="select mock location app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Change your device’s location</strong></p><p>That’s it! Now you can launch the mock location app and enter the address or coordinates of any target location. You can further adjust the pin and drop it anywhere you like to spoof the Apple iPhone 6s device’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-location-on-lexa.jpg"                      alt="fake location on lexa"                ></p><p>There you go! After reading this post, I’m sure that you would be able to know about the iSpoofer use for Pokemon Go. Since iSpoofer has been shut down, you can no longer use it to change your Apple iPhone 6s location. Therefore, you can consider <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (iOS &amp; Android) as an ideal iSpoofer alternative for your device. In just a few clicks, you can change the location of your Apple iPhone 6s anywhere you like and that too without jailbreaking your phone.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-exclusive-selection-best-10-cameras-for-win-11-recording/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Exclusive Selection Best 10 Cameras for Win 11 Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-essential-strategies-for-memorable-youtube-closings-for-2024/"><u>[New] Essential Strategies for Memorable YouTube Closings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/g54-5g-messages-recovery-recover-deleted-messages-from-g54-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-messages/"><u>G54 5G Messages Recovery - Recover Deleted Messages from G54 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-sim-card-on-nokia-c110-online-without-jailbreak-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock SIM Card on Nokia C110 online without jailbreak</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-effective-methods-to-fake-gps-location-on-android-for-your-motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, 3 Effective Methods to Fake GPS location on Android For your Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-all-you-need-to-know-about-mega-greninja-for-apple-iphone-13-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, All You Need To Know About Mega Greninja For Apple iPhone 13 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-do-you-get-sun-stone-evolutions-in-pokemon-for-apple-iphone-xs-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How Do You Get Sun Stone Evolutions in Pokémon For Apple iPhone XS Max? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-apple-iphone-11-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How PGSharp Save You from Ban While Spoofing Pokemon Go On Apple iPhone 11? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-come-up-with-the-best-pokemon-team-on-apple-iphone-6-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Come up With the Best Pokemon Team On Apple iPhone 6 Plus? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-legendaries-are-in-pokemon-platinum-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, What Legendaries Are In Pokemon Platinum On Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/master-the-art-of-writing-discover-9-uses-for-chatgpt-when-penning-novels/"><u>Master the Art of Writing: Discover 9 Uses for ChatGPT When Penning Novels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/resolving-connectivity-problems-fixing-the-ralink-rt3290-driver-on-windows-11-8-and-7/"><u>Resolving Connectivity Problems: Fixing the Ralink RT3290 Driver on Windows 11, 8 & 7</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Evolutions mean a boost in stats and strength in raids. Plenty of Pokémon users are conversant with the traditional raiding as a way to evolve. However, you can use special items to evolve your Pokémon. One such item is the dawn stone. In this article, we are going to take you through a detailed guide on dawn stone evolutions and how to get it with ease.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Dawn-Stone-Pokemon-Evolutions"><a href="#Part-1-Dawn-Stone-Pokemon-Evolutions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Dawn Stone Pokémon Evolutions"></a>Part 1. Dawn Stone Pokémon Evolutions</h2><h3 id="What-is-Dawn-Stone-in-Pokemon-Sword-and-Shield"><a href="#What-is-Dawn-Stone-in-Pokemon-Sword-and-Shield" class="headerlink" title="What is Dawn Stone in Pokémon Sword and Shield?"></a>What is Dawn Stone in Pokémon Sword and Shield?</h3><p>Like Shiny Stone, dusk stone, Sun Stone, and Moon Stone, Dawn Stone is another peculiar evolution item in Pokémon Sword and Shield. If you combine Dawn Stone with certain Pokémon, they will evolve to another level. This peculiar stone was introduced in Generation IV, and in terms of appearance, Dawn Stone sparkles like a glittering eye.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/dawn-stone.jpg"                      alt="dawn stone"                ></p><p>You can get dawn stone from the Digging Duo found near the Wild Area nursery. You will, however, be required to pay them 500 watts before digging random items for you. Remember, this is a trial and error thing, and you might have to spend a lot of watts before finding a dawn stone. Also, you can get any evolutionary stone, including the Dawn Stone in the Lake of Outrage. Here, you will have to first obtain a Rotom Bike on route 9 to move across the water.</p><h3 id="Pokemon-that-Evolve-with-Dawn-Stone"><a href="#Pokemon-that-Evolve-with-Dawn-Stone" class="headerlink" title="Pokémon that Evolve with Dawn Stone"></a>Pokémon that Evolve with Dawn Stone</h3><p>As aforementioned, dawn stone is an evolution item that is used to evolve certain species of Pokémon. To evolve your Pokémon using Dawn Stone in Pokémon Sword and Shield, enter the bag menu and choose the “Other Items” tab. Hover on the Dawn Stone and select the “Use this item” option. Finally, select the Pokémon to evolve. These Pokémon that can be evolved using dawn stone include:</p><h3 id="1-Kirlia"><a href="#1-Kirlia" class="headerlink" title="1. Kirlia"></a>1. Kirlia</h3><p>Kirlia is a small humanoid Pokémon whose upper body and arms are white while the waist and legs are light green. This makes it appear as though it is wearing tights. Kirlia’s natural abilities include synchronization and trace. It loves dancing on sunny mornings and becomes more beautiful when they sense e positive emotions of trainers. A vast majority of Kirlia live in the cities, although some are still found in the forest. Kirlia evolved from Ralts and has two possible evolutions, namely Gardevoir and Gallade. If it reaches level 30, it evolves to Gardevoir. However, if it is male and given a dawn stone, it will evolve to Gallade.</p><h3 id="2-Snorunt"><a href="#2-Snorunt" class="headerlink" title="2. Snorunt"></a>2. Snorunt</h3><p>Snorunt is an ice-type Pokémon that was introduced in Generation III. It is also referred to as the “Snow Hat Pokémon.” You can find Snorunt in seafoam café, snow canyon, or even in Mysterious Grotto. Furthermore, you can obtain it by trading or Pokémon Roulette. Snorunt can evolve into Glalie or Froslass. If it reaches level 42, Snorunt evolves to Glalie. For Snorunt to evolve into Froslass, it requires a dawn stone. However, the Snorunt must be a female to evolve to Froslass.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Hacks-and-Tricks-to-get-Dawn-Stone-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-2-Hacks-and-Tricks-to-get-Dawn-Stone-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

So, up your XP game by using lucky eggs, completing research quests, and catching more Pokémon.</li><li><strong>Trade with other players.</strong> If you have friends who also play Pokémon Go, you can trade rare and even legendary Pokémon with them. Just make sure you’re in a specific range with them.</li><li><strong>Use incense and lures.</strong> Both of these will help you attract more Pokémon. As for Lures, once they are used on a PokeStop, any player can enjoy its effects as a bonus.</li><li><strong>Play on the Community Days.</strong> If you’re looking to catch a Shiny Pokémon, don’t forget to play on community days. It is important because Shinies have a much higher rate of appearing during these days!</li><li><strong>Have friends in other regions.</strong> You cannot complete your Pokedex without getting region-exclusive Pokémon! Having friends from other regions ensures you can trade regional Pokémon with each other.</li><li><strong>Use a virtual GPS at home.</strong> If you don’t have anyone to trade your regional Pokémon with, you can use a virtual location. It can be achieved by using a specialized app, like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for this purpose to access rare locations and get more Pokémon!</li></ul><p>Considering time and money, the first few of the above methods are not so easy to realize in practice. So here, we are exclusively introducing one of the most efficient and low-cost ways - virtual GPS to catch, power up, and evolve your Pokémon. Are you ready to complete your Pokedex faster?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136621/26400" target="_top" id="2136621">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136621" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136621/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-is-Dr-Fone-–-Virtual-Location"><a href="#What-is-Dr-Fone-–-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="What is Dr.Fone – Virtual Location"></a>What is Dr.Fone – Virtual Location</h3><p>Dr.Fone Virtual Location is a super useful software when it comes to spoofing the locations of your device.

Then click on “get started”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Connect Device</strong></p><p>Now, you need to take your Apple iPhone 7’s cable and use it to connect your Apple iPhone 7 to the PC.

Maybe you need to trust the PC if you are plugging the Apple iPhone 7 device for the first time.</p><p><strong>Step 3: See your Location</strong></p><p>Now on the interface, you’d see a map with your location highlighted on it. If your location is incorrectly displayed then click on the “center on” option. Now the location displayed would be accurate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="virtual location 03"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Activate Teleport Mode</strong></p><p>Subsequently, activate the “teleport mode” by clicking the icon shown in the image.

Now click on “go”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137226/26400" target="_top" id="2137226">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137226" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137226/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 5: Change Location</strong></p><p>Upon clicking on “go”, a pop-up will appear showing you the distance of the location you have chosen.

You can evolve several pokemons just by trading them. There are several pokemon that you can evolve using trading. Given below is the list of the different pokemon that can benefit from evolution.</p><ul><li>Kadabra</li><li>Machoke</li><li>Graveler</li><li>Haunter</li><li>Boldore</li><li>Gurdurr</li><li>Karrablast</li><li>Shelmet</li></ul><p>However, trading Pokemons in Pokemon go could be slightly tricky without having at least one close friend in the games who is also of a considerable level. Only then, you will be able to evolve your pokemon by trading.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-do-the-special-trade"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-do-the-special-trade" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to do the special trade?"></a>Part 3: How to do the special trade?</h2><p>You need a Special Trade whenever you wish to trade a legendary Pokemon or a shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Go. These pokemon are very rare to find and hence you won’t want to trade these rare Pokemons very often, however, you can trade a rare Pokemon only once per day. To trade a rare Pokemon would also need to be a Great or Best friend, two of the highest levels of friendship in the game Pokemon go. To increase your friendship level you need to battle and trade more and more. It’ll take quite a bit of time to reach that stature of a friendship level. This could cost as much as one million, this amount will however decrease with increasing friendship levels.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Trading in Pokemon go was introduced in recent times and had now become one of the most integral factors of the game. Pokemon go trading has changed the gaming trend. However, you could get an upper hand by using a virtual location changer such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This can help you to even trade pokemons seamlessly with friends staying at far-off places. Using the pokemon trade feature and evolving pokemons is a smart and handy way to progress further in the game. As a Pokemon go player, you must try it out!</p><h2 id="A-Detailed-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-List-to-Make-you-a-Pro-Trainer-For-Apple-iPhone-7"><a href="#A-Detailed-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-List-to-Make-you-a-Pro-Trainer-For-Apple-iPhone-7" class="headerlink" title="A Detailed Pokemon Go PvP Tier List to Make you a Pro Trainer For Apple iPhone 7"></a>A Detailed Pokemon Go PvP Tier List to Make you a Pro Trainer For Apple iPhone 7</h2><p>If you have been playing Pokemon PvP battle leagues, then you might already know how tough the competition is. To win more matches and rank-up, players take the assistance of a Pokemon Go PvP tier list. With the help of a tier list, you can know what Pokemons to pick and identify some of the strongest contenders. In this post, I’m going to share dedicated Pokemon Go great, ultra, and master tier lists to help you pick the best Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-pvp-tier-list-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go pvp tier list banner"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148775/18498" target="_top" id="2148775">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148775" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148775/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-How-are-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-Lists-Evaluated"><a href="#Part-1-How-are-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-Lists-Evaluated" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How are Pokemon Go PvP Tier Lists Evaluated?"></a>Part 1: How are Pokemon Go PvP Tier Lists Evaluated?</h2><p>Before you go through our carefully calculated great, ultra, and master league Pokemon Go tier list, you should know some basics. Ideally, the following parameters are considered while placing any Pokemon in a tier list.</p><p><strong>Moves:</strong> The most important factor is the amount of damage any move can do. For instance, some moves like thunderbolt are more powerful than others.</p><p><strong>Pokemon type:</strong> The type of Pokemon also plays a vital role. You might already know that some Pokemon types can easily be countered while others have fewer counters.</p><p><strong>Updates:</strong> Niantic keeps updating Pokemon levels to have a balanced Pokemon Go PvP tier list. That’s why the current nerf or buff on any Pokemon would change their position in the list.</p><p><strong>CP levels:</strong> Since the three leagues have CP limits, the overall CP value of any Pokemon is also vital to place them in a tier list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-levels-pokemon-leagues.jpg"                      alt="cp levels pokemon leagues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-A-Complete-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-List-Great-Ultra-and-Master-Leagues"><a href="#Part-2-A-Complete-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-List-Great-Ultra-and-Master-Leagues" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Complete Pokemon Go PvP Tier List: Great, Ultra, and Master Leagues"></a>Part 2: A Complete Pokemon Go PvP Tier List: Great, Ultra, and Master Leagues</h2><p>Since Pokemon Go PvP matches are based on different leagues, I have also come up with Pokemon ultra, great, and master league tier lists to help you pick the most powerful Pokemon in every match.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886019/19272" target="_top" id="1886019">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886019" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886019/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Pokemon-Go-Great-League-Tier-List"><a href="#Pokemon-Go-Great-League-Tier-List" class="headerlink" title="Pokemon Go Great League Tier List"></a>Pokemon Go Great League Tier List</h3><p>In Great League matches, the maximum CP of any Pokemon can be 1500.

Using it, you can catch any Pokemon remotely from the comfort of your home without jailbreaking your device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135357/19272" target="_top" id="2135357">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135357" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135357/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Most-Asked-Questions-about-Pokemon-Go-Battle-League-Rewards-On-Apple-iPhone-7"><a href="#Most-Asked-Questions-about-Pokemon-Go-Battle-League-Rewards-On-Apple-iPhone-7" class="headerlink" title="Most Asked Questions about Pokemon Go Battle League Rewards On Apple iPhone 7"></a>Most Asked Questions about Pokemon Go Battle League Rewards On Apple iPhone 7</h2><p>Ever since Pokemon Go Battle League matches have been introduced, players have shifted their focus on ranking up.

It is a Dragon-type Pokemon that evolves into Dragonair and then into Dragonite. Dratini is a popular Pokemon among players due to its rarity and powerful evolution. If you are looking to catch Dratini on your Apple iPhone 6s, you may be wondering where the best place to find them is.</p><p>Dratini is one of the Pokémon creatures that resemble a snake. It has an elongated blue body with a blue white underside. It carries three-pronged fins on each side of its head which are white in color. Dratini also has a white bump on the forehead.</p><p>Dratini has an energy level that is constantly increasing, which makes it grow and can reach a length of more than 6 feet. It sheds its skin every time it has to grow, and usually hide behind a waterfall when shedding. The colony of Dratini lives underwater, living at the bottom feeding on food that falls from the upper levels. Outrage is the signature move for this Pokémon creature.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-evolution-of-Dratini"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-evolution-of-Dratini" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the evolution of Dratini?"></a>Part 1: What’s the evolution of Dratini?</h2><p>Dratini undergoes two different evolutions</p><p>The first un-evolved version is the serpentine Dratini that looks like a snake and continues shedding its skin as it grows. When you get to level 30, Dratini evolves into Dragonair, and at level 55 it becomes Dragonite</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528703/16446" target="_top" id="1528703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528703/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Dragonair"><a href="#Dragonair" class="headerlink" title="Dragonair"></a>Dragonair</h3><p>This is an evolution of Dratini, which has a long scaly serpent-like body. It still retails the blue body with a white underside. The white bump on the forehead now becomes a white horn. The budding wings on the side of the head have now grown into full wings. It also carries three crystal orbs, with one on the neck and the other two on the tail.</p><p>Dragonair has the ability to stretch its wings so it can fly. It has a huge amount of energy in the body and can discharge the energy through the crystals. The energy that it releases has the ability to change the weather wherever it is. Dragonair can be found in seas and lakes.</p><h3 id="Dragonite"><a href="#Dragonite" class="headerlink" title="Dragonite"></a>Dragonite</h3><p>This is a Pokémon character that truly resembles a dragon and is the second evolution of Dratini. It has a yellow thick body, and a couple of antennae that come out of its forehead. It has a striated underbelly. The body is quite large when compared to the small wings.</p><p>Dragonite can fly at very high speeds despite its bulky appearance. It is a kindhearted Pokémon, which is as intelligent as a human being. It has been found to have tendencies to save humans from disasters, such as saving those who have come from a capsized ship on the high seas. It lives near the sea and is extremely rare in the Pokémon world.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-can-I-find-the-Dratini-nest"><a href="#Part-2-Where-can-I-find-the-Dratini-nest" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where can I find the Dratini nest?"></a>Part 2: Where can I find the Dratini nest?</h2><p>Dratini is a Pokémon that lives in the water. Since it loves lakes and seas, you can find it when you visit areas that are near water. For example, in the United States, the most famous nests for Dratini are found in North Eastern San Francisco, Pier 39 and Pier 15. You will always find Dratini at these sites and they are famous for people who want to farm Dratini.</p><p>You may also g West to Squirtle Nest where you can get a lot of Dratini.</p><p>Dratini has a 5% spawning chance every day, so if you have the time, you can spend it on these sites as you enjoy the watery view and wait for it to appear.</p><p>Dratini nests can also be found in other parts of the world, such as Tokyo, Japan; Sydney and New South Wales, Australia; Paris, France and others.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Are-the-Dratini-nest-and-spawn-spot-in-the-same-place"><a href="#Part-3-Are-the-Dratini-nest-and-spawn-spot-in-the-same-place" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Are the Dratini nest and spawn spot in the same place?"></a>Part 3: Are the Dratini nest and spawn spot in the same place?</h2><p>This is quite a common question for those who are new to the Pokémon universe. Basically, Dratini nests and spawn points are the same for a period of two weeks. The nests then migrate leaving the spawn points to spawn different types of Pokémon.</p><p>If the Dratini nest migrates, it can still come back in the future. You should always keep an eye at the spawn point where you first encountered your first Dratini Nest; it may come back once more and you can continue farming Dratini.</p><p>Dratini nests will migrate on alternate Thursdays at midnight. The nest migrations are random, so make sure that you visit and hit them many times over the two weeks in order to get the most Dratini that you can.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1936838">                    <video width="374" height="48" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1936838.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1936838">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1936838.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:234px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fcoinrule.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1936838%2F18409'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1936838/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-increase-the-possibility-of-earning-Pokemon-Go-Dratini"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-increase-the-possibility-of-earning-Pokemon-Go-Dratini" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to increase the possibility of earning Pokémon Go Dratini?"></a>Part 4: How to increase the possibility of earning Pokémon Go Dratini?</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Dratini can be found in certain places around the world. If you live outside these regions, you cannot be able to get Dratini. The best way to go about getting Dratini in such cases is to virtually relocate your device. This means that you can take your device to Tokyo nest sites even if you live in Africa.</p><p>The best app to use for teleportation is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)</strong></p><ul><li>Instantly teleport to an area where a Dratini nest has been found and remotely collect as many as you can.</li><li>Use the joystick feature to move around the map until you come across Dratini.</li><li>The app allows you to seem to be walking, riding a bike, or in a vehicle, on the map.

With these, you can find and catch Asia-specific Pokemon in North America and vice versa.</p><p>It’s worth noting that these special events are pretty rare in Pokemon GO.

When you’re playing with other users, you can earn Stardust based on the number of your previous wins, your game level, and the PVP outcome.</p><p>For instance, if you’re a Rank 2, you can earn around 2,000 Stardust points by winning a battle, and if you’re Rank 24, the number increases to about 200,000. You can also use a Star Piece to multiply your winnings by 1.5.</p><p>Another method is to play with your friends, and the Stardust points can vary from 300 to 1000, depending on your opponent’s rank.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-3.jpg"                      alt="pvp in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Opening-Gifts"><a href="#By-Opening-Gifts" class="headerlink" title="By Opening Gifts"></a>By Opening Gifts</h3><p>Opening gifts is one of the main components of the Pokemon Go experience. You’ll get daily gifts you can open for free, earn valuable items, and support your gameplay. Each gift can carry a certain amount of Stardust particles, so you don’t have to do anything to accumulate these items.</p><p>The maximum Stardust you can get in one gift is 300, which may not seem like a lot. However, if you open your gifts regularly, you’ll have the desired Stardust amount in no time. You should also combine this method with others mentioned in this article for the best experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-4.jpg"                      alt="opening gifts in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Hatching-Pokemon"><a href="#By-Hatching-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="By Hatching Pokemon"></a>By Hatching Pokemon</h3><p>Hatching a Pokemon is also one of the essential parts of your Pokemon experience. Every time you hatch an egg, you’ll get Stardust points you can spend on numerous instances. The Stardust amount will depend on the egg itself; the higher the rank, the better the prices.</p><p>You can check out the list below to determine how much Stardust you’ll collect through your egg hatching:</p><ul><li>400–800 Stardust for hatching a 2km egg;</li><li>600–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 5km egg;</li><li>800–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 7km egg;</li><li>1600–3200 Stardust for hatching a 10km egg;</li><li>3200–6400 Stardust for hatching a 12km egg.</li></ul><p>You can also use the Star Piece item to multiply the Stardust amount by 1.5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-5.jpg"                      alt="eggs in pokemon go"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016129/19272" target="_top" id="2016129">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016129" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016129/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="By-Catching-Pokemon"><a href="#By-Catching-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="By Catching Pokemon"></a>By Catching Pokemon</h3><p>Catching Pokemon is one of the most efficient ways of earning Stardust points. Each Pokemon has a base rate of 100 Stardust points, but you can earn more points depending on the Pokemon’s evolution stage. For instance, if the Pokemon is in the second stage, you’ll earn an additional 500 Stardust points.</p><p>Another thing you should look out for is specific Pokemon characters – some may carry more than 100 Stardust points as their base. For instance, you can get a whopping 2,100 Stardust points if you catch Audino, 950 for Garbodor, 1,000 for Chimecho, etc.</p><p>If you stay consistent and catch at least one Pokemon daily, you can get up to 9,000 Stardust points on the seventh day. Moreover, the first catch of the day will bring you an additional 1,800 points.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-6.jpg"                      alt="catch a pokemon"                ></p><h3 id="By-Claiming-Raid-Rewards"><a href="#By-Claiming-Raid-Rewards" class="headerlink" title="By Claiming Raid Rewards"></a>By Claiming Raid Rewards</h3><p>When the Boss enters your Gym, you may think it’s a stressful scenario. However, you should consider the bright side and fight to earn valuable rewards, such as Stardust points.</p><p>Once you and your team defeat the Boss, you can collect the prizes. You’ll win 1,000 Stardust points each time a Boss enters, even if it leaves the Gym without a fight.</p><p>If you defeat the boss, you’ll also get a chance to catch the Pokemon, which can bring you even more Stardust points!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-7.jpg"                      alt="a raid battle in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Getting-Rocket-Rewards"><a href="#By-Getting-Rocket-Rewards" class="headerlink" title="By Getting Rocket Rewards"></a>By Getting Rocket Rewards</h3><p>Rocket rewards are sets of items you get after fighting the Team Go Rocket.

Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events</h2><p>While incredibly straightforward and helpful, changing your virtual location isn’t the only way you can go about catching Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures.</p><p>The game’s special events often remove regional Pokemon distribution restrictions, allowing exclusive creatures to spawn around the globe for a particular period. With these, you can find and catch Asia-specific Pokemon in North America and vice versa.</p><p>It’s worth noting that these special events are pretty rare in Pokemon GO. You’ll need to pay close attention to the game’s announcements, as you don’t want to miss an opportunity to add another, hard-to-find, regional Pokemon to your Pokedex.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Trading-Regional-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-7-Trading-Regional-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 7.

Players can find other users from around the globe and initiate Pokemon GO creature exchanges to complete their Pokedex with all the available regionals.</p><p>However, trading regional Pokemon can also be quite challenging as it requires finding users willing to swap their region-specific Pokemon for the ones you have. There’ll undoubtedly be situations where users might not want to give up a more valuable catch for the one in your region, making trading a less viable option than changing your virtual location.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Completing your Pokedex and becoming the ultimate Pokemon trainer in Niantic’s viral AR game can be particularly challenging due to Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures. To catch these, players must travel to regions where these Pokemon spawn, trade with other users who’ve visited these areas, or wait for the game’s special events to lift regional spawn restrictions.</p><p>Alternatively, Pokemon trainers can use GPS-spoofing apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone and its Virtual Location Changer feature to change their mobile device’s GPS location.

Kirlia’s natural abilities include synchronization and trace. It loves dancing on sunny mornings and becomes more beautiful when they sense e positive emotions of trainers. A vast majority of Kirlia live in the cities, although some are still found in the forest. Kirlia evolved from Ralts and has two possible evolutions, namely Gardevoir and Gallade.

Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Stops Guide"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Pokemon-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.</p><p>Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg"                      alt="Exploring Pokemon Go Stops"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-Lure-Modules-on-Poke-Stops-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?</h2><p>Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.</p><p>These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store</strong></strong></p><p>Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg"                      alt="Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go</strong></strong></p><p>Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg"                      alt="Add Pokestop Lure Module"                ></p><p>That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg"                      alt="Lure Module Installed on Pokestop"                ></p><p>For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Make-Pokestops-into-Farming-Spots-in-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?"></a>Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?</h2><p>With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.</p><p><strong><strong>Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby</strong></strong></p><p>You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.</p><p>In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.</p><p><strong><strong>Use Lure Modules with Friends</strong></strong></p><p>Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you&#x2F;your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Explore-Pokemon-Go-Stops-Remotely-without-Walking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?"></a>Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?</h2><p>While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 12’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:</p><p><strong><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 12 and Launch the Application</strong></strong></p><p>At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 12 to the system using a working cable and trust the system. On the interface of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), just agree to its terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043661/7443" target="_top" id="2043661">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043661" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043661/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong><strong>Step 2: Enter the Details of the Target Location</strong></strong></p><p>Once your Apple iPhone 12 is detected by the interface, its present location would be displayed with other details. To spoof the location of your Apple iPhone 12 on Pokemon Go, you can click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Now, you can go to the search options on the top-left side and enter the address or exact coordinates of the Pokestop. You can find the location of a Pokestop from several freely available online sources.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone 12 Location to a Pokemon stop</strong></strong></p><p>As you would enter the location, the interface will automatically change to the designated spot. You can now move the pin around on the map and even zoom in&#x2F;out to drop it at the exact spot. In the end, just click on the “Move Here” button to spoof your Apple iPhone 12’s location and visit the Pokemon stop virtually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Besides that, you can also use the one-stop or multi-stop modes of the application to simulate your movement and visit the nearby Pokemon Go stops.</p><p>I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to know about Poke stops in Pokemon Go. I have included several tips that I implement to find Pokemon stops near me in this guide. Though, if you want to catch more Pokemons via Pokemon Go stops, then you can simply use Lure Modules.

You can take it slowly and try to work your way up one step at a time.</p><h3 id="It-serves-as-your-key-to-special-tournaments-and-worldwide-events"><a href="#It-serves-as-your-key-to-special-tournaments-and-worldwide-events" class="headerlink" title="It serves as your key to special tournaments and worldwide events"></a>It serves as your key to special tournaments and worldwide events</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/pokemon-go-pvp-rank-2.JPG"                      alt="pokemon go battles"                ></p><p>Pokemon Go is holding various tournaments from time to time. However, some of these events require players to garner a specific rank or rating in Pokemon Go PvP battles. That means you cannot join if you don’t meet a particular rank level required in the game. Therefore, strive harder to participate in PvP games and win as many duels as you can. Your Pokemon PvP ranking is not just a mere group of numbers. It actually defines your eligibility to join prestigious Pokemon Go events. Hence, take it very seriously.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030380/11832" target="_top" id="1030380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030380/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Get-Started-With-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Rank-Battles"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Get-Started-With-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Rank-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.
