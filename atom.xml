For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency.

Fixed"></a>Why is iPogo not working On Apple iPhone XS Max? Fixed</h2><p>The popular iPogo app is one of the best free apps you can use to spoof on your device while playing Pokémon Go. It is equipped with an abundance of features that allows players to get way ahead in the game by spotting spawns early, catching gym raids, discovering nests and quest events, and so on. If you spot a Pokémon which is way too far from your location, you can use iPogo to fake your virtual coordinates and trick Pokémon Go to think you are nearby that area. Sounds like an amazing app to use right? But, there is a downside to it too as users of the app have repeatedly reported of iPogo not working. The app seems to overload and malfunction after a few hours of repeated usage. This issue is preventing users from harnessing the full potential of their gaming experience.</p><h3 id="Why-Users-download-iPogo"><a href="#Why-Users-download-iPogo" class="headerlink" title="Why Users download iPogo?"></a>Why Users download iPogo?</h3><p>iPogo is a free to use Pokémon Go++ mod which can be downloaded as an APK file for your iOS devices. It features tools that can be used by players to play the game virtually anywhere in the world while also enhancing the gameplay experience. Few of these exclusive features have been mentioned in the list below;</p><ul><li>The Spin and Auto-cash feature can be used to capture Pokémon and throw a spinning ball without requiring a physical device.</li><li>With just one click you can manage your collection of stored items. It removes the cumbersome ordeal of the game to manually select and delete items when you can erase all un-required items with just one tap.</li><li>If you are on the hunt for special shiny Pokémon, you can do so without having to go through dozens of non-shiny one’s. On activating the Auto-Runaway feature on your iPogo, you can skip through the time consuming animations of all non-shiny Pokémon.</li><li>You can augment the game to let your avatar walk continuously at a desired pace. The speed of your avatar’s movement can be adjusted using iPogo.</li><li>If there are unnecessary elements crowding up your screen, you can hide them temporarily.</li><li>You keep track of Pokémon spawns, quests and raids using the feed on your iPogo.</li></ul><p>With all these amazing benefits at hand, it seems almost unfair to not be able to make the best of it if iPogo keeps crashing or stops working. Let’s look into the probable reasons why your iPogo is not working and explore methods to solve this dilemma.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-problem-that-iPogo-is-not-working"><a href="#Part-1-Common-problem-that-iPogo-is-not-working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working"></a>Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working</h2><p>Pokémon Go players have made several reports of how iPogo is not functioning normally on their devices. For instance, while using the Plus mod on Pokémon Go, the Apple iPhone XS Max device screen goes completely black and unresponsive making the game inaccessible. Also, devices that run Pokémon Go with iPogo seems to be running slower than those which do not use any helper or spoofing support.</p><p>Even if your device is able to withstand the load of using iPogo, it may still be possible to face other app related performance issues like ipogo enhanced-throw not working, ipogo joystick not working and ipogo feeds not working either. All these symptoms sums up the fact that the iPogo app is faltering on your device.</p><p>Read on to understand the reasons why your device is unable to run the iPogo mod smoothly;</p><ul><li>One of the root causes which explains why iPogo is crashing could be because you are utilizing too much of your phone’s system resource capacity. This means you have too many tabs or other applications opened on your device that is making the resource distribution falter leading to an automatic shutdown.</li><li>Another plausible reason could be that your iPogo application has not been properly installed. It is widely agreed upon that iPogo is a difficult app to install as it involves going through complex steps making it easier for mistakes to be made, eventually leading to a complete breakdown of the software.</li><li>Since installing iPogo is a cumbersome process, players would often resort to using downloading hacks to get the job done faster. However, not all such hacks can be relied upon as they may end up jail breaking your device or make your version of the app even more unstable.</li></ul><h3 id="Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue"><a href="#Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue" class="headerlink" title="Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue"></a>Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue</h3><p>It is often said that short cuts can cut you short or in this case, hacked! Disrupting the framework of your device is not price you should pay for enjoying the game at its best. Although, there are other safer and more reliable solutions to making the iPogo app run better on your iOS device. Let’s take a brief peak at some of them.</p><ul><li><strong>Limiting the usage of System Resources:</strong> Let’s keep in mind that it is unwise to keep too much on your plate and rightfully so. In this case, the more applications you keep active on your shortcut bar, the lesser resources your CPU has left to allocate to the iPogo app. Therefore, close off all other unnecessary applications before launching iPogo as it is already a heavy enough application to run on its own.</li><li><strong>Too many Items opened:</strong> Keep a tight check on your list of inventory while playing Pokémon Go using iPogo. Remember to delete all un-required collected items as it may be taking up too much space and wasting precious system resources.</li><li><strong>Keep you Device Clean:</strong> Not essentially in the literal sense but yes, it is indeed important to clean up your device often. Use a cleaner app that deletes and clears all those extra cache files that becomes the primary reason of system lag on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Install the Official Version:</strong> It may be tempting for anyone to install the app using shortcut hacks, but that’s all they are – just hacks! Installing iPogo seem like the long way but it is the right way on all accounts. There are three methods you can use to integrate the official iPogo app, all of which has been made more simplified.</li></ul><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Use the three-step app installation method which is direct and free to use.</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If you are opting for a matrix installation, in which case you will need a PC installed with either Windows, LINUX or MacOS.</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> The Signulous method is a premium mod that gives the player access to additional features.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> All of these installation methods have specific varied requirements which must be checked appropriately.</p><h2 id="Part-2-A-better-alternative-for-iPogo-virtual-location"><a href="#Part-2-A-better-alternative-for-iPogo-virtual-location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location"></a>Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location</h2><p>If using the iPogo mod to enhance your gaming experience on Pokémon Go seem less appealing with all the added hassle then there is a better alternative for you to use.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.</p><p>There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned"></a>Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned</h2><p>The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp"><a href="#Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp"></a>Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp</h2><p>Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency. Also, you can fake your personal details as it is a beta key.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-5.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Now, once you got the beta key, fill it in the login details to use the PGSharp. Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.</p><p>The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.</p><p>Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.</p><h3 id="2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp"><a href="#2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp"></a>2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp</h3><p>There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account. You should not use your main account to fake GPS with PGSharp. First, create a PTC account and then install PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go without a ban.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-6.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Also, make sure to uninstall the official account to spoof the location to help you catch more Pokémon in less time.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?"></a>Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?</h2><p>Spoofing on the iPhone is a little more difficult than on Android. So, if you own an iPhone, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to fake location. It is easy to use and easy to install. Further, this app is 100% safe to install on the iPhone as it causes no threat to your device or data.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo"></iframe><p>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also saves you from a ban and doesn’t require jailbreaking the Apple iPhone XS device. You can teleport to any location with it in seconds. Wondersahare specially designed it for iOS users and Android users, but the Pokemon GPS cheat is not available on Android.</p><p>To use it, you will need to install it on your device from the official site or click the “<em>Try It Free</em>“ button below directly. Once installed, connect your Apple iPhone XS to your computer and click on get the started icon. Now you have the world map-like interface where you can search for any desired location to spoof. So, all in all, it is very easy to use for a novice too. The best part is that it causes no ban like other unsafe spoofing apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Pokemon Go is a very interesting game and brings a lot of fun while playing. With reliable and trusted apps like PGsharp for android, you can spoof it without a ban. For iOS, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app is best for fake GPS without a ban.

If you own an iOS device, then I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which provides excellent location spoofing solutions.

Just click on the third option (One-stop route) and look for any location from the search bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="walk mode"                ></p><p>Now you can just select the number of times you wish to move and complete other settings, such as enabling the realistic and fluctuation mode. After that, click on the “Move Here” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="confirm marching"                ></p><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong><br>1. <strong>Realistic Mode:</strong> It enhances the realism of the simulation by fluctuating the speed during the simulation.<br>2. <strong>Fluctuation Mode</strong>: This feature enables you to move around within a 5-meter range after reaching your destination, instead of remaining static. This helps to make the GPS location change more realistic, making it less likely for Pokemon Go to detect the use of the virtual location.</em></p><p>This will just start the simulation, and you can even adjust the speed from a slider at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="start the simulation"                ></p><p><strong><em>Step 3: Move along multiple spots</em></strong></p><p>Using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), you can also simulate an entire route between multiple spots as well.

You can also change your walking speed from a slider as well.</p><p>In this way, you can learn how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking at the convenience of your home!</p><h2 id="Way-2-Use-an-Android-Location-Spoofer"><a href="#Way-2-Use-an-Android-Location-Spoofer" class="headerlink" title="Way 2: Use an Android Location Spoofer"></a>Way 2: Use an Android Location Spoofer</h2><p>This is one of the quickest ways to learn how to hatch Pokemon Go eggs without walking. If you own an Android device, then you can simply use a GPS spoofing app to manually change the location of your device. This will trick Pokemon Go into believing that you are walking instead. For iPhone users, the feature would need a jailbroken device though.</p><p>While changing your location, make sure that you do it tactfully. For instance, if an egg would need 10 kilometers of walking, then change your location gradually instead of just switching it in one go. Here’s <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong> by using a GPS spoofer.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, unlock your Android phone and go to its Settings &gt; About Phone to tap the Build Number field 7 times. This will unlock the Developer Options settings on your Android.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock the Developer Options settings"                ></p></li><li><p>Now, go to the Play Store and install a reliable location spoofing app on your phone. Later, visit Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn it on. Also, allow mock locations on the phone and choose the installed app from here.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-3.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing app"                ></p></li><li><p>That’s it! Now you can just launch the fake GPS app and manually change your location to a few meters away to trick Pokemon Go.

Most of the eggs in Pokemon Go would need you to walk 2, 5, or 10 kilometers. The good news is that an average drone can easily cover this distance. Firstly, get a working drone on which you can easily place your phone. It is recommended to get a lock so that your device won’t fall while it is on a drone. Once your phone is successfully attached to a drone, just use it to cover a substantial distance. Make sure that the speed is minimal so that Pokemon Go would believe that you are walking instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-5.jpg"                      alt="Play Pokemon Go with a drone"                ></p><p><strong>Things to Remember</strong></p><ul><li>While doing so, don’t forget about the safety of your phone as it can get stolen by someone if it goes too far.</li><li>Use a lock and make sure that your phone won’t fall from your drone.</li><li>Enable the Find My Apple iPhone XS service on your Android or iPhone so that you can locate your phone if it is lost.</li><li>Move your drone slowly so that Pokemon Go would not detect that you are using a drone or playing the game while driving.</li></ul><h2 id="Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users"><a href="#Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users" class="headerlink" title="Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users"></a>Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users</h2><p>A while back, Pokemon Go enabled the option to add friends on the app and send them gifts. Presently, we can send gifts to 20 other friends from our account in a day. Therefore, if you have a lot of friends, then you can send them eggs, including the exclusive 7 km egg. There are tons of online sources and forums for people to exchange their friend codes for Pokemon Go.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, Launch Pokemon Go on your phone and go to your profile.

There are all kinds of incubators available in the game that can help you hatch eggs without walking much.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, make sure that you have enough Pokecoins with you. If not, launch the app and tap on the Pokeball from its home to visit its shop.</p></li><li><p>From here, you can buy as many Pokecoins as you want.

You can just place your phone carefully on your bike or skateboard and cover the needed distance to hatch more eggs. While you would still have to go out for this, the effort needed would be far less than walking.</p><p>Just make sure that you stay safe while riding your bike or skateboard. Don’t focus too much on catching new Pokemons. Instead, just cover the needed distance to hatch the egg. Also, ride your bike or skateboard slowly to make sure Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-10.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Bike or Skateboard"                ></p><h2 id="Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go"></a>Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you have a Roomba or any other robotic cleaner in the house, then you can also take its assistance to hack Pokemon Go eggs. All you got to do is place your phone on the Roomba and let it move around in your house. Since the robotic cleaner would move slowly, it will make Pokemon Go believe that you are walking instead. Just be sure that your phone will stay safe and protected. I would recommend placing it in a waterproof lock to further protect it from any wear and tear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-11.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Roomba"                ></p><h2 id="Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go"></a>Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you are already into model railroads, then you won’t face any issues playing Pokemon Go. It would be the replica of a big railroad with miniature trains. Simply place your phone on a miniature train and let it revolve around the railroad to cover the distance. Just keep your phone safe and regulate the speed of the train to make sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement. You would have to drive your train for a while to cover the distance, but you don’t have to walk to do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-12.jpg"                      alt="Model Railroad"                ></p><h2 id="Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go"></a>Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go</h2><p>Do you have a turntable?

This trick is for anyone who wants to be a quick hatch in Pokemon Go! Here are the steps:</p><p>Place your phone on the outermost edge of the turntable &gt; Turn on the turntable &gt; Confirm if your eggs are starting to hatch.

If you are wondering why there are certain types of Pokémon enlisted as ‘blanks’ in your Pokedex and you haven’t yet found them, it’s probably because they are marked as ‘regional’ types. This means that these Pokémon are exclusively locked in select regions around the world. Don’t Panic! You don’t have to spend a boat load of cash in order to catch these special regional Pokémon as there are tricks you can apply to catch them without even stepping out of your kitchen.</p><h2 id="Part-1-List-of-the-regional-Pokemon-that-have-been-announced"><a href="#Part-1-List-of-the-regional-Pokemon-that-have-been-announced" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced"></a>Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced</h2><p>Since the game publishers released these special regional Pokémon, they have been locked in their geo-specific locations around the world. There is a set or pair of regional Pokémon for each generation that has been introduced into the game. Regions may not be defined by real-time borders but are divided according to the type of the Pokémon and the place they are more likely to spawn.</p><p>These places may be specific to countries (Tauros spawn in the US), specific to a continent (Mr.Mime Spawn in Europe), specific to a region (Corsola spawn in the Tropics), and even certain halves of the planet (Lunastone and Solrock spawn in the Southern half and Northern half of the equator, respectively). These Pokémon are not necessarily rare spawn types. If you are traveling in their region, they may pop up quite frequently. You should take note that regional Pokémon won’t become available in Gyms or in Nests since they will only spawn in the wild. However, you can yet find them through eggs but only in their specific regions.</p><p>There are some exceptions among the regionals as well. These exceptions are known to swap their spawn locations or drop out of regional exclusivities like Zangoose and Seviper, or Minun and Plusle. Some regional Pokémon may also turn up in special in-game events like how Farfetch’d spawned during the 2017 Pokémon Go Travel Challenge.</p><p>If you are not a frequent traveler or know fellow trainers who are willing to trade their regional Pokémon then you may need to be patient and follow a few extra steps in order to get your hands on these rare types of Pokémon.</p><p>List of different Regional Pokémon – Where and How to Catch them All!</p><p>As of now, there are over 40 different regional Pokémon divided across generations that can be captured or hatched only in specific expanses of the world. There are of course occasional overlaps of Pokémon slipping out of their region and into other sectors. Let’s get into the list of all the region-specific Pokémon of different generations and where to find them.</p><h3 id="Gen-1-Kanto-Pokemon"><a href="#Gen-1-Kanto-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Gen 1&#x2F; Kanto Pokémon"></a>Gen 1&#x2F; Kanto Pokémon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/kanto-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="kanto pokemon"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Taouros:</strong> North America.</li><li><strong>Farfetch’d:</strong> Asia.</li><li><strong>Mr. Mime:</strong> Europe.</li><li><strong>Kangashkhan:</strong> Australia&#x2F;Pacific.</li></ul><h3 id="Gen-2-Johto-Pokemon"><a href="#Gen-2-Johto-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Gen 2&#x2F; Johto Pokémon"></a>Gen 2&#x2F; Johto Pokémon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/johto-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="johto pokemon"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Heracross:</strong> South America&#x2F; Southern Florida.</li><li><strong>Corsola:</strong> Equatorial Latitudes.</li></ul><h3 id="Gen-3-Hoenn-Pokemon"><a href="#Gen-3-Hoenn-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Gen 3&#x2F; Hoenn Pokémon"></a>Gen 3&#x2F; Hoenn Pokémon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/hoenn-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="hoenn pokemon"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Tropius:</strong> The Middle East and Africa.</li><li><strong>Torkoal:</strong> Southeast Asia.</li><li><strong>Volbeat:</strong> Europe, Australia, and Asia.</li><li><strong>Relicanth:</strong> The Cook Islands&#x2F;New Zealand.</li><li><strong>Solrock:</strong> Currently America and Africa.

When they spawn near your location, you catch it by throwing a Poke ball at it. If the Poke ball is seen shaking, it means that the Pokémon is resisting and may just pop out from the ball in which case you may have to throw another one at it. Now, if you are traveling and you have limited time or a number of spawns then here are a few tips you can utilize to enhance your chances of landing a catch.</p><ul><li><strong>Curve Ball:</strong> Practice your curveball throws. Throwing a curve ball automatically increases your chances of preventing a Pokémon from slipping through your hands, plus you also get a 17x bonus with each successful curve catch.</li><li><strong>Maximize your Medals:</strong> Medals increase your performance in the game without costing you any extra resources like Great balls, Ultra Balls, or Razz Balls. So, try and max out your medals to increase your chances of catching rare Pokémon, especially the exclusive ones.</li><li><strong>Keep Consistent:</strong> The algorithm of the game is quite complex but eventually, a pattern emerges. You will notice that if you keep practicing with great or excellent catches with the smaller (low XP) Pokémon, it increases your chances of catching the ones that put up a fight.</li><li><strong>Save your Berries:</strong> Feeding a Pokémon with Razz Berries increases your assurances of catching the Pokémon while also giving you a 15x bonus when you land a successful catch. Save your berries for those persistent Pokémon spawns.</li><li><strong>Use Powerful Poke balls:</strong> Last but definitely not least, use powerful balls like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball to maximize your chances of catching Pokémon. You should also remember that these are diminishable resources so use them wisely. On catching a Pokémon with a Great ball you will get 15x and with an Ultra ball you would get 2x so utilize them accordingly to catch rare and super rare Pokémon.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The journey to completing your Pokedex may not be a short one as there are hundreds of Pokémon out there, and even hundreds more yet to be introduced into the game. Traveling the world in search of the rarest regional Pokémon is meant to be a fun and exciting experience, yet it may not be viable for some who wish to enjoy the game to the fullest. Utilizing a fake GPS and VPN can bridge the gaps in your Pokedex and keep the game fun for you at the same time. So keep playing and catching Pokémon as there are loads of other exciting installments yet to be introduced by Niantic in the future.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-apple-iphone-7-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How PGSharp Save You from Ban While Spoofing Pokemon Go On Apple iPhone 7 Plus? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/unova-stone-pokemon-go-evolution-list-and-how-catch-them-for-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Unova Stone Pokémon Go Evolution List and How Catch Them For Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-can-i-create-my-pokemon-overworld-maps-on-apple-iphone-se-2020-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How Can I Create My Pokemon Overworld Maps On Apple iPhone SE (2020)? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-come-up-with-the-best-pokemon-team-on-apple-iphone-15-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Come up With the Best Pokemon Team On Apple iPhone 15 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/the-magnificent-art-of-pokemon-go-streaming-on-apple-iphone-12-mini-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>The Magnificent Art of Pokemon Go Streaming On Apple iPhone 12 mini? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/here-are-different-ways-to-find-pokemon-go-trainer-codes-to-add-to-your-account-on-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Here are Different Ways to Find Pokemon Go Trainer Codes to Add to Your Account On Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/why-cant-i-install-the-ipogo-on-apple-iphone-6s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Why cant I install the ipogo On Apple iPhone 6s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-come-up-with-the-best-pokemon-team-on-apple-iphone-12-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Come up With the Best Pokemon Team On Apple iPhone 12 Pro? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-get-the-meltan-box-pokemon-go-for-apple-iphone-7-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Ultimate guide to get the meltan box pokemon go For Apple iPhone 7 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-pokemon-go-cooldown-chart-on-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Pokémon Go Cooldown Chart On Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/is-mega-mewtwo-the-strongest-pokemon-on-apple-iphone-7-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Is Mega Mewtwo The Strongest Pokémon On Apple iPhone 7 Plus? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-can-i-catch-the-regional-pokemon-without-traveling-on-apple-iphone-x-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How Can I Catch the Regional Pokémon without Traveling On Apple iPhone X | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/which-pokemon-can-evolve-with-a-moon-stone-for-apple-iphone-xs-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Which Pokémon can Evolve with a Moon Stone For Apple iPhone XS? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/top-15-augmented-reality-games-like-pokemon-go-to-play-on-apple-iphone-xs-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Top 15 Augmented Reality Games Like Pokémon GO To Play On Apple iPhone XS Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-pokemon-go-no-gps-signal-heres-every-possible-solution-on-apple-iphone-6-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Pokemon Go No GPS Signal?

This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind.

For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency.

You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account.

Some of them are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>iPhone version:</strong></li></ul><p>The current iPhone version you are choosing may be responsible for the problem for iPogo can’t install.

At that moment, you need to be patient and try re-installation.</p><ul><li><strong>Direct download method:</strong></li></ul><p>If a user is considering direct downloading method, they might also face this trouble because Apple now targets certificate.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp"><a href="#Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp"></a>Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp</h2><p>Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency.

Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.</p><p>The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.</p><p>Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.</p><h3 id="2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp"><a href="#2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp"></a>2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp</h3><p>There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account.

What Are the Possible Leagues in Pokémon GO PvP"></a>Part 1. What Are the Possible Leagues in Pokémon GO PvP</h2><p>There are three core leagues in the trainer battles in Pokémon GO, namely Great, Ultra, and Master. Each of these leagues has its own CP limitation and comes in rotation during each season. So, you have to learn to battle in each of them to get seamless rewards. Let’s look at each of these leagues individually for a better understanding of the <strong>best Pokémon for PvP</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/everything-to-know-about-pvp-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon pvp battles"                ></p><h3 id="1-Great-League"><a href="#1-Great-League" class="headerlink" title="1. Great League"></a>1. Great League</h3><p>The Great League is the easiest league to jump into for beginners. Here, only Pokémon with 1,500 CP or less can join the battle. This low CP cap makes Pokémon with lower maximum CP shine, like Azumarill and Altaria. These Pokémon might not stand out in the other leagues, but in the Great League, they can dominate the battlefield.</p><h3 id="2-Ultra-League"><a href="#2-Ultra-League" class="headerlink" title="2. Ultra League"></a>2. Ultra League</h3><p>The next league that comes is Ultra League, which raises the CP cap to 2,500. Legendary Pokémon start making appearances here, with a focus on defensive power. Pokémon like Registeel and Cresselia excel in this league, but there are also many other Pokémon that hold their own valuable potential.</p><p>In the same way, Venusaur with Frenzy Plant and Swampert with Hydro Cannon are also popular choices in this league.</p><h3 id="3-Master-League"><a href="#3-Master-League" class="headerlink" title="3. Master League"></a>3. Master League</h3><p>The Master League removes all CP limits, allowing any Pokémon to jump into the action. Here, Trainers tend to lean towards Pokémon with high maximum CP. Pokémon like Groudon and Origin Forme Giratina are notable here, making them fit for any kind of battle.</p><p>Surprisingly, some Pokémon are not commonly picked for Raids, like Dialga and Altered Forme Giratina. However, they are powerful competitors and key contributors to the Master League.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Strongest-Pokemon-To-Use-in-Each-Pokemon-GO-PvP-League"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Strongest-Pokemon-To-Use-in-Each-Pokemon-GO-PvP-League" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.</p><p>There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned"></a>Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned</h2><p>The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp"><a href="#Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp"></a>Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp</h2><p>Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency. Also, you can fake your personal details as it is a beta key.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-5.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Now, once you got the beta key, fill it in the login details to use the PGSharp. Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.</p><p>The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.</p><p>Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.</p><h3 id="2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp"><a href="#2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp"></a>2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp</h3><p>There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account. You should not use your main account to fake GPS with PGSharp. First, create a PTC account and then install PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go without a ban.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-6.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Also, make sure to uninstall the official account to spoof the location to help you catch more Pokémon in less time.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?"></a>Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?</h2><p>Spoofing on the iPhone is a little more difficult than on Android.

By doing so, Niantic can’t catch you.</li><li>Never use a modified game or third-party client to catch Pokémon. You never know the client may be a worker in the developer’s office. Therefore, you will get caught easily.</li><li>You need to be very careful about your movement in the game. If you are using a fake GPS app, then make sure your movements are reasonable. It means do not switch long-distance locations in few hours or frequently. It is because this makes it unreal in Niantic radar and may cause you a problem.</li><li>Finally, do not root your Phone, be it Android or iPhone. It is because when you root your device, its security gets compromised, and it is easy to get data about your device’s fake location. And, your Pokémon Go account also can be at risk.</li></ul><p>Therefore, in order to catch special and maximum Pokémon, you do not need to cheat the game, only PGSharp is enough.

Since Pachirisu is a region-specific Pokemon, chances are that you might not see it spawning everywhere. Though, if you use the right Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, then you can easily locate it. In this post, I’m going to suggest some working Pachirisu regional maps so that you can catch this Pokemon like a pro.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Things-You-Should-Know-About-Pachirisu"><a href="#Part-1-Things-You-Should-Know-About-Pachirisu" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu"></a>Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu</h2><h3 id="What-are-Pokemon-GO-Pachirisu-Features"><a href="#What-are-Pokemon-GO-Pachirisu-Features" class="headerlink" title="What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?"></a>What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?</h3><p>Due to the many tinkles around Pachirisu, this part will delve into every detail of this Pokemon. It’s a squirrel-like creature that can glide after spreading its arms. This electric-type Pokemon is region-exclusive and only available in the Sinnoh region. The best moves of Pachirisu are Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, which are perfect for defense and offense.</p><p>It’s an EleSquirrel Pokemon that can win battles in rainy weather. Pachirisu is good against flying, steel, and electric-type Pokemon GO moves, whereas it is vulnerable to ground-type moves. This cute little guy would be an excellent pick in battles that can attack with fur balls.</p><p>You can evolve it into Mega Pachirisu with mega gems, but more evolution isn’t possible.

Since it can hide pretty well, you would have to keep a keen eye to look for it. A Pokemon Go regional map for Pachirisu can further help you.</p><h3 id="Are-there-Pachirisu-locations-with-coordinates"><a href="#Are-there-Pachirisu-locations-with-coordinates" class="headerlink" title="Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?"></a>Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?</h3><p>As introduced before, Pachirisu is primarily found in areas of Alaska, Canada, and certain parts of Russia.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide fixed coordinates for Pachirisu encounters as they can vary over time.</p><p>To increase your chances of finding Pachirisu, it is recommended to visit areas with a higher likelihood of spawning regional exclusives, such as parks, tourist attractions, or areas with a diverse range of Pokémon spawns. Additionally, participating in Pokémon Go events or connecting with local Pokémon Go communities can provide valuable information on Pachirisu sightings in your region.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Pachirisu-Pokemon-Go-Regional-Maps-to-Help-You"><a href="#Part-2-Pachirisu-Pokemon-Go-Regional-Maps-to-Help-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You"></a>Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You</h2><p>Since Pachirisu is mostly spawned in Alaska, Canada, and Russia, you might need to take some extra measures to locate it.

To make things easier, you can just use a location spoofer application. While there are plenty of mock GPS apps for Android devices, iPhone users often find it hard to spoof their device location. Well, in this case, I would suggest <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that can spoof your Apple iPhone SE location without jailbreaking it.</p><p>With just a few clicks, you can directly teleport to anywhere in the world by entering the location’s address or its coordinates.

Once you have noted the coordinates or address from the Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, you can follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone SE and launch the tool</strong></p><p>To start with, just launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) application on your computer and connect your Apple iPhone SE to it.

Can I catch Pachirisu outside of its regional range?</strong></p><p>Pachirisu is a regional-exclusive Pokemon that only spawns in Alaska, Canada, and Russia. It is a rare Pokemon that only inhabitants of the Northern Hemisphere can catch. To get this Pokemon, you can use Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location and spoof your location to the Pachirisu region.</p><p><strong>2. Are there any events or special occasions when Pachirisu becomes more accessible?</strong></p><p>Yes, Pachirisu is an event-exclusive Pokemon that appears in the Pokémon GO Fest Global event. This event is restricted to a few days and limited hours, and you also need tickets to participate.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There you go! After getting to know about these Pokemon Go regional maps for Pachirisu, you can easily catch this electric-type Pokemon. Since it is not possible to go to Canada or Russia to catch it, you can use a Pachirisu Pokemon Go map to get its spawn coordinates. Later, you can use an application like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (iOS) to spoof your Apple iPhone SE location and catch a new Pachirisu without going out. For that, you don’t have to go through any technical hassle or even jailbreak your device!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-get-and-use-pokemon-go-promo-codes-on-apple-iphone-6s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Get and Use Pokemon Go Promo Codes On Apple iPhone 6s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-get-the-meltan-box-pokemon-go-for-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Ultimate guide to get the meltan box pokemon go For Apple iPhone 13 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/why-cant-i-install-the-ipogo-on-apple-iphone-x-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Why cant I install the ipogo On Apple iPhone X | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/latest-way-to-get-shiny-meltan-box-in-pokemon-go-mystery-box-on-apple-iphone-xs-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Latest way to get Shiny Meltan Box in Pokémon Go Mystery Box On Apple iPhone XS | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/where-is-the-best-place-to-catch-dratini-on-apple-iphone-8-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Where Is the Best Place to Catch Dratini On Apple iPhone 8 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-pokemon-go-joystick-on-apple-iphone-14-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to use Pokemon Go Joystick on Apple iPhone 14?

If you own an Android device, then you can simply use a GPS spoofing app to manually change the location of your device. This will trick Pokemon Go into believing that you are walking instead. For iPhone users, the feature would need a jailbroken device though.</p><p>While changing your location, make sure that you do it tactfully. For instance, if an egg would need 10 kilometers of walking, then change your location gradually instead of just switching it in one go. Here’s <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong> by using a GPS spoofer.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, unlock your Android phone and go to its Settings &gt; About Phone to tap the Build Number field 7 times. This will unlock the Developer Options settings on your Android.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock the Developer Options settings"                ></p></li><li><p>Now, go to the Play Store and install a reliable location spoofing app on your phone. Later, visit Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn it on. Also, allow mock locations on the phone and choose the installed app from here.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-3.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing app"                ></p></li><li><p>That’s it! Now you can just launch the fake GPS app and manually change your location to a few meters away to trick Pokemon Go. Do the same a few times to cover a prominent distance.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-4.jpg"                      alt="change your location to a few meters away"                ></p></li></ol><p>Just be sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect that you are using a GPS spoofer to hatch eggs.

Most of the eggs in Pokemon Go would need you to walk 2, 5, or 10 kilometers. The good news is that an average drone can easily cover this distance. Firstly, get a working drone on which you can easily place your phone. It is recommended to get a lock so that your device won’t fall while it is on a drone. Once your phone is successfully attached to a drone, just use it to cover a substantial distance. Make sure that the speed is minimal so that Pokemon Go would believe that you are walking instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-5.jpg"                      alt="Play Pokemon Go with a drone"                ></p><p><strong>Things to Remember</strong></p><ul><li>While doing so, don’t forget about the safety of your phone as it can get stolen by someone if it goes too far.</li><li>Use a lock and make sure that your phone won’t fall from your drone.</li><li>Enable the Find My Apple iPhone SE (2022) service on your Android or iPhone so that you can locate your phone if it is lost.</li><li>Move your drone slowly so that Pokemon Go would not detect that you are using a drone or playing the game while driving.</li></ul><h2 id="Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users"><a href="#Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users" class="headerlink" title="Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users"></a>Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users</h2><p>A while back, Pokemon Go enabled the option to add friends on the app and send them gifts. Presently, we can send gifts to 20 other friends from our account in a day. Therefore, if you have a lot of friends, then you can send them eggs, including the exclusive 7 km egg. There are tons of online sources and forums for people to exchange their friend codes for Pokemon Go.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, Launch Pokemon Go on your phone and go to your profile. Adjacent to the “Me” section, tap on the “Friends” section instead.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-6.jpg"                      alt="go to your profile"                ></p></li><li><p>Here, you can see a list of your friends and an option to add more friends on Pokemon Go. To add a friend, you need to enter their code which can be obtained from any dedicated forum or even Reddit.</p></li><li><p>That’s it! Once you have added a friend, go to their profile, and choose to trade or send them a gift.

Using it, you can buy all kinds of tools, incense, eggs, incubators, and even Pokemons. Though, if you wish to learn how to hack eggs in Pokemon Go without moving, then consider getting some incubators. There are all kinds of incubators available in the game that can help you hatch eggs without walking much.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, make sure that you have enough Pokecoins with you. If not, launch the app and tap on the Pokeball from its home to visit its shop.</p></li><li><p>From here, you can buy as many Pokecoins as you want.

You can just place your phone carefully on your bike or skateboard and cover the needed distance to hatch more eggs. While you would still have to go out for this, the effort needed would be far less than walking.</p><p>Just make sure that you stay safe while riding your bike or skateboard. Don’t focus too much on catching new Pokemons. Instead, just cover the needed distance to hatch the egg. Also, ride your bike or skateboard slowly to make sure Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-10.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Bike or Skateboard"                ></p><h2 id="Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go"></a>Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you have a Roomba or any other robotic cleaner in the house, then you can also take its assistance to hack Pokemon Go eggs. All you got to do is place your phone on the Roomba and let it move around in your house. Since the robotic cleaner would move slowly, it will make Pokemon Go believe that you are walking instead. Just be sure that your phone will stay safe and protected. I would recommend placing it in a waterproof lock to further protect it from any wear and tear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-11.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Roomba"                ></p><h2 id="Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go"></a>Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you are already into model railroads, then you won’t face any issues playing Pokemon Go. It would be the replica of a big railroad with miniature trains. Simply place your phone on a miniature train and let it revolve around the railroad to cover the distance. Just keep your phone safe and regulate the speed of the train to make sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement. You would have to drive your train for a while to cover the distance, but you don’t have to walk to do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-12.jpg"                      alt="Model Railroad"                ></p><h2 id="Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go"></a>Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go</h2><p>Do you have a turntable?

This trick is for anyone who wants to be a quick hatch in Pokemon Go!

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.</p><p>There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned"></a>Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned</h2><p>The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp"><a href="#Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp"></a>Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp</h2><p>Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option.

However, if you open your gifts regularly, you’ll have the desired Stardust amount in no time. You should also combine this method with others mentioned in this article for the best experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-4.jpg"                      alt="opening gifts in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Hatching-Pokemon"><a href="#By-Hatching-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="By Hatching Pokemon"></a>By Hatching Pokemon</h3><p>Hatching a Pokemon is also one of the essential parts of your Pokemon experience. Every time you hatch an egg, you’ll get Stardust points you can spend on numerous instances. The Stardust amount will depend on the egg itself; the higher the rank, the better the prices.</p><p>You can check out the list below to determine how much Stardust you’ll collect through your egg hatching:</p><ul><li>400–800 Stardust for hatching a 2km egg;</li><li>600–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 5km egg;</li><li>800–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 7km egg;</li><li>1600–3200 Stardust for hatching a 10km egg;</li><li>3200–6400 Stardust for hatching a 12km egg.</li></ul><p>You can also use the Star Piece item to multiply the Stardust amount by 1.5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-5.jpg"                      alt="eggs in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Catching-Pokemon"><a href="#By-Catching-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="By Catching Pokemon"></a>By Catching Pokemon</h3><p>Catching Pokemon is one of the most efficient ways of earning Stardust points. Each Pokemon has a base rate of 100 Stardust points, but you can earn more points depending on the Pokemon’s evolution stage. For instance, if the Pokemon is in the second stage, you’ll earn an additional 500 Stardust points.</p><p>Another thing you should look out for is specific Pokemon characters – some may carry more than 100 Stardust points as their base. For instance, you can get a whopping 2,100 Stardust points if you catch Audino, 950 for Garbodor, 1,000 for Chimecho, etc.</p><p>If you stay consistent and catch at least one Pokemon daily, you can get up to 9,000 Stardust points on the seventh day. Moreover, the first catch of the day will bring you an additional 1,800 points.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-6.jpg"                      alt="catch a pokemon"                ></p><h3 id="By-Claiming-Raid-Rewards"><a href="#By-Claiming-Raid-Rewards" class="headerlink" title="By Claiming Raid Rewards"></a>By Claiming Raid Rewards</h3><p>When the Boss enters your Gym, you may think it’s a stressful scenario. However, you should consider the bright side and fight to earn valuable rewards, such as Stardust points.</p><p>Once you and your team defeat the Boss, you can collect the prizes. You’ll win 1,000 Stardust points each time a Boss enters, even if it leaves the Gym without a fight.</p><p>If you defeat the boss, you’ll also get a chance to catch the Pokemon, which can bring you even more Stardust points!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-7.jpg"                      alt="a raid battle in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Getting-Rocket-Rewards"><a href="#By-Getting-Rocket-Rewards" class="headerlink" title="By Getting Rocket Rewards"></a>By Getting Rocket Rewards</h3><p>Rocket rewards are sets of items you get after fighting the Team Go Rocket. Each time you beat this criminal group, you’ll be rewarded with either 500 or 1,000 Stardust points, depending on whether you were fighting Grunt or Team Go Leader.</p><p>Additionally, if you ever face Giovanni, you’ll get 5,000 points for fighting and beating him.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-8.jpg"                      alt="rocket battle in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Earning-Research-Rewards-Through-Completed-Tasks"><a href="#By-Earning-Research-Rewards-Through-Completed-Tasks" class="headerlink" title="By Earning Research Rewards Through Completed Tasks"></a>By Earning Research Rewards Through Completed Tasks</h3><p>Each player will get their daily to-do list depending on their skill and game level. Once you enter the app, you can complete these daily tasks for Stardust points.</p><p>The amount of points you will win depends on the task’s difficulty and duration. However, you should complete all the daily tasks to accumulate as many consumables as possible.</p><p>For instance, if you’re on level 45, you can head to the Go Battle League 45 times to earn 4,500 Stardust points.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-9.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go research tasks"                ></p><h3 id="By-Visiting-the-Gym"><a href="#By-Visiting-the-Gym" class="headerlink" title="By Visiting the Gym"></a>By Visiting the Gym</h3><p>While on your daily walk in the Pokemon world, you should check out whether you can find some Gyms around you. If you do, stop by to hang around with some of the most precious Pokemon characters and give them a berry while you’re there.</p><p>You’ll earn 20 Stardust points for each berry you give a Pokemon. It may be the easiest way to earn and use these points for your experience. Plus, you’ll meet new characters and fully experience what the Pokemon world offers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-10.jpg"                      alt="giving berries to pokemon characters"                ></p><h3 id="Claim-Stardust-Quickly-in-Pokemon-Go-by-Using-Location-Spoofing"><a href="#Claim-Stardust-Quickly-in-Pokemon-Go-by-Using-Location-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Claim Stardust Quickly in Pokemon Go by Using Location Spoofing"></a>Claim Stardust Quickly in Pokemon Go by Using Location Spoofing</h3><p>If you live in a rural area and don’t get too many chances to walk around and catch Pokemon characters, you can use a classic trick of location spoofing.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.</p><p>There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go.

After a player has lodged few fast moves, (number of fast moves required for each Pokémon to charge attack, varies) the trainer’s Pokémon can lodge a secondary yet stronger charged attack to deal more damage.</p><p>The bug in the series implied that a Pokémon – “Melmetal” is able to recharge their charge attack even while attacking with a “Charged” move, essentially making the trainer using the Pokémon invincible during a real battle.</p><p>Several trainers immediately tweeted this excruciating bug to Niantic requesting this issue to be resolved immediately, as a result Niantic had to freeze the leader board for that season.</p><p>Players when entering the Battle League are shown – Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available Right Now, and all matches that were in progress were not concluded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-1.jpg"                      alt="pokemon 1"                ></p><p>Thankfully, the issue has been resolved and trainers can get back into the league without any change in the previous features.</p><p>Here’s a set of few known issues in the game currently being investigated by Niantic, which we can hope to see resolved later on in the future;</p><ul><li><strong>Inconsistent Fast Attacks against Opponent Charged Attacks –</strong> Your fast attacks don’t land a direct hit when the opponent is throwing his Charged Attack.</li><li><strong>Fast Attacks are slower on Android –</strong> Most android users are experiencing slower fast attacks than iOS users.

It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.</p><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.</p><p>The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower.

Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.</p><p>The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work"><a href="#Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?"></a>Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?</h2><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.</p><p>The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.</p><p><strong>958D8046<br>A7151D70<br>8BB602F7<br>8CEB681A.</strong></p><p>All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.</p><p>If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.</p><p>You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.</p><p>When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:<br><strong>82005274 0001</strong></p><p>You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”.

All you have to do is go up to the register and then buy a Pokéball, and you will get a Master Ball instead, without having to pay a dime.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-4.jpg"                      alt="Enter PokeMart to but Pokémon Emerald Master Balls"                ></p><p>Only one Master Ball can be bought at a time, but you can do this as many times as you want. If you are already inside the PokeMart when you enter the code, you may have to walk out and walk back in again for it to work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-5.jpg"                      alt="Buy as many Pokémon Emerald Master Balls as you would like using the cheat code"                ></p><p>When you have shopped for Pokémon Emerald Master Balls to your fill, you need to disable the code so your store can go back to normal. All you have to do is go back to the “Cheat List” window and then uncheck the two little lines of Pokémon Emerald Master ball cheat codes.</p><p>Make sure that you exit the store and go back again to finish the process properly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-6.jpg"                      alt="Disable the Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat code when you are finished shopping"                ></p><p>The best thing about this method is that you do not need to enter another master ball cheat code in the future.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind.

With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store.

For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.</p><p>There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned"></a>Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned</h2><p>The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp"><a href="#Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp"></a>Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp</h2><p>Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency.

Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.</p><p>The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.</p><p>Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.</p><h3 id="2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp"><a href="#2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp"></a>2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp</h3><p>There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.</p><p>There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned"></a>Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned</h2><p>The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp"><a href="#Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp"></a>Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp</h2><p>Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key.

This reward doesn’t only show Giovani’s hideout, it also shows some of his Grunts hideouts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-does-the-Pokemon-Go-Giovani-Counter-Contain"><a href="#Part-2-What-does-the-Pokemon-Go-Giovani-Counter-Contain" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What does the Pokemon Go Giovani Counter Contain?"></a>Part 2. What does the Pokemon Go Giovani Counter Contain?</h2><p>Giovani remains the toughest beast amongst all the Team Go Rocket Leaders. When you find him in the game, be prepared to face his wrath. To defeat him, you need a powerful team.</p><p>The big boss choice of legendary Shadow Pokemon and second party members changes every month- the Pokemon you fought against the previous month will be different from that of the present month and thereafter.</p><p>Giovani’s lineup of creatures for October 2022 is shown below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Lineup of Creature</th><th>Pokemon</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>First</td><td>Persian</td></tr><tr><td>Second</td><td>Kangashkan, Nidoking, Garchomp</td></tr><tr><td>Third</td><td>Mewtwo</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For the Pokemon, Persian, and Kangashkan, try to have a Lucario, Conkeldurr, or Machamp in your team and you are good to defeat them.</p><p>When you encounter Nidoking or Garchomp, your team has to change. You will need to have a strong ice-type Pokemon on your team. The reason is that this new Lineup of creatures is strong on land and could cause substantial damage to the dragon-type Pokemon in case you wanna choose them.</p><p>Picking any of these great ice-type Pokemon, Mamoswine, Glaceon, or Weavile when you face Nidoking or Garchomp is a perfect choice. However, we recommend Mamoswine, because he isn’t just an ice-type Pokemon but also a strong ground-type Pokemon.</p><p>Once you defeat Team Go Rocket’s second lineup creatures, you will have to battle against the legendary psychic Pokemon, Mewtwo, who is weak to this set of Pokemon; bug, ghost, and Dark-type Pokemon. So beating this Pokemon Go Giovani grunt shouldn’t be a tedious task as you’ve got a plethora of choices when deciding the Pokemon-type to use. Origin Giratina and Tyranitar are some strong Dark-type Pokemon you can use to defeat Mewtwo.</p><p>Now you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against each lineup of creatures, leverage it to advance to the next phase of the game where you will face the big bad boss himself, Giovani.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Beat-Giovani-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Beat-Giovani-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

With that, you can use the same Pokemon twice, thereby keeping your choice for Legendary Shadow Pokemon safe till you need it to beat Giovani.</p><p>Mind you, the big bad boss, Giovani has two Protect Shields at his disposal so you have to be careful while fighting against the monster. We implore you to start your game with a Pokemon that has a Charged move so you can charge as fast as possible.</p><p>Getting a strong Pokemon won’t come with ease, however, with the use of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone- Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can achieve this.

With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency.

You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.</p><p>There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned"></a>Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned</h2><p>The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp"><a href="#Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp"></a>Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp</h2><p>Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency. Also, you can fake your personal details as it is a beta key.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-5.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Now, once you got the beta key, fill it in the login details to use the PGSharp. Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.</p><p>The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.</p><p>Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.</p><h3 id="2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp"><a href="#2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp"></a>2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp</h3><p>There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account. You should not use your main account to fake GPS with PGSharp. First, create a PTC account and then install PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go without a ban.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-6.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Also, make sure to uninstall the official account to spoof the location to help you catch more Pokémon in less time.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?"></a>Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?</h2><p>Spoofing on the iPhone is a little more difficult than on Android.

Tap the build number about five times until a pop-up notification <strong>‘You are now a developer’</strong> appears.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Download the Fake GPS Location app to your Android device</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokekom-go-teleport-safely-13.jpg"                      alt="download the fake gps location on your Android"                ></p><p>Go to the Google Play Store and download Fake GPS Location to your Android phone.

Sadly, players can’t explore their surroundings or travel to play the game all the time. That’s why they often take the assistance of a Pokemon Go joystick. While Pokemon joysticks are extremely popular, they have some downfalls as well if you don’t pick the right tool. Therefore, in this post, I will list the risks and benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick hack to help you make up your mind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Joystick Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Pokemon-Go-Joystick-101-Things-to-Know"><a href="#Part-1-Pokemon-Go-Joystick-101-Things-to-Know" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Pokemon Go Joystick 101: Things to Know"></a><strong>Part 1: Pokemon Go Joystick 101: Things to Know</strong></h2><p>Before we get into the details, it is important to know the basics of this fake GPS Pokemon Go hack. Ideally, Pokemon Go joysticks are dedicated mobile or desktop applications that let us simulate the movement of our device. In most of the spoofing tools for Pokemon Go, the following features are offered.</p><ul><li>Users can directly spoof their location on Pokemon Go to anywhere they like in the world.</li><li>They can also simulate the movement of their device (and the trainer) using the inbuilt joystick.</li><li>The Pokemon Go Joystick APK can also let you set up a preferred speed for walking, jogging, or running.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Joystick"                ></p><p>Therefore, with the help of a Pokemon Go hack APK like this, players don’t have to leave their house to catch Pokemons. They can also participate in raids to hatch eggs from the comfort of their home.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Playing-Pokemon-Go-with-a-Joystick"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Playing-Pokemon-Go-with-a-Joystick" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?"></a><strong>Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?</strong></h2><p>There are several reasons why Pokemon Go joystick iOS&#x2F;Android hacks are so popular. After all, they give us the convenience to play our favorite game without breaking a sweat. Here are some of the major reasons why Pokemon Go joystick hacks are becoming so popular:</p><ul><li><p>Stay Safe Indoors</p><p>  Since we are in the middle of a global pandemic, it is not recommended to go out to explore Pokemons. Besides that, your neighborhood might not be safe or there could be unfavorable weather conditions outside. Therefore, you can consider using a Pokemon Go joystick to catch Pokemons without compromising your safety.</p></li><li><p>Move Beyond your Area</p><p>  If you are in a rural area, then chances are that there could be limited spawning locations for Pokemons. With a fake GPS Pokemon Go app, you can spoof your location to any major city.</p></li><li><p>Catch More Pokemons</p><p>  One of the major benefits of using a Pokemon Go spoofer APK is that we can easily catch tons of Pokemons without exploring any area. Just enter the exact spawning location of the Pokemon and catch it!</p></li><li><p>Level-up in the Game Easily</p><p>  From participating in raids to hatching eggs faster, there are so many other things that you can do with a Pokemon Go joystick.</p></li><li><p>Have a Better Gaming Experience</p><p>  Overall, a Pokemon Go spoofing iOS&#x2F;Android solution will provide tons of add-on features that would improve your gaming experience.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-What-are-the-Risks-of-Using-Pokemon-Go-Joysticks"><a href="#Part-3-What-are-the-Risks-of-Using-Pokemon-Go-Joysticks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?"></a><strong>Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?</strong></h2><p>While there are numerous benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick, its constant use can also backfire in the long run.</p><ul><li><p>Account Ban by Niantic</p><p>  Ideally, you should know that the use of any third-party service (like a fake GPS Pokemon Go hack) is against the terms and conditions of the game. At first, if Niantic will detect its use, then it will simply display a warning message. Though, after several warning messages, if your account is still flagged, then it can get permanently banned.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-3.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Account Ban"                ></p><p>  To avoid the banning of your Pokemon Go account, you can consider a “cooldown duration”. This simply suggests waiting for a specific duration before changing your location in the game.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-4.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Cooldown Duration"                ></p></li><li><p>Software Hack on Jailbroken Devices</p><p>  To use a Pokemon Go joystick iOS hack, you might have to jailbreak your device. This can even null the warranty of your device and would make it susceptible to security threats. You might already know that a jailbroken device can easily be corrupted by the spoofer or any other app.</p></li><li><p>The Pokemon Go Spoofing Company Might Shut Down</p><p>  Chances are that the Pokemon Go spoofing solution that you have purchased might go out of business. For instance, iSpoofer (an iOS fake GPS tool) is no longer functioning and its existing users can’t even reach out to its customer support after getting their account banned. That’s why it is highly recommended to only pick a reliable Pokemon Go joystick solution.</p></li></ul><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>As you can see, picking a reliable Pokemon Go joystick is the most important thing to play the game remotely.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency.

Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.</p><p>The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.</p><p>Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.</p><h3 id="2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp"><a href="#2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp"></a>2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp</h3><p>There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp.

To replicate the position and guarantee that the iOS gadget is associated with the application, open the Virtual Location property using a functioning lightning cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p>You can click the ‘Get Started’ button to initiate the action as soon as your phone gets detected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="virtual location 01"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Mirroring Motion amid steps:</strong></p><p>Unfold the top right area of the initial option before reaching Dr. Fone’s GUI, which permits you to imitate maneuver amid the two spots. Pick the positioning pin and click on the ‘transfer here’ button in the search bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="virtual location 08"                ></p><p>To begin the replication, you will be required to make a movement and traverse the ‘March’ button to reach it multiple times. By default, the action is set to one but can be outweighed by the user, and the plan will change correspondingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="virtual location 09"                ></p><p>The change location will act as genuine for the Pokémon Go application, and it will presume that the player is moving in between the two points you chose on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the rate of motion can also be modified, making use of the gliding menu. By following these steps, you can use the fake motion of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without needing to understand it, and your app will not be banned.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="virtual location 10"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="virtual location 11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:</strong></p><p>Dr. Fone’s application also lets you fake your motion joining more than two positions. The attribute is called after the multi-stop path that can be highlighted from the GUI toolbox class situated at the top-right position, which allows you to release several accurate endpoints on the map, and your position will take action correspondingly as managed by the virtual position application of Dr. Fone.</p><p>To let the system duplicate flow by choosing the accurate choices, press the ‘March’ button. You will have to do the Pokémon Go walking trick at some point. Dr. Fone’s virtual motion replicator application makes your life a lot easier and lets you do the job without having to worry about travel charges.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png"                      alt="virtual location 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-get-the-dragon-scale-on-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-get-the-dragon-scale-on-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to get the dragon scale on Pokémon Go?"></a>Part 3: How to get the dragon scale on Pokémon Go?</h2><p>Pokemon go dragon scale can be obtained by taking charge of Gyms and spinning, waiting for the Pokestops to give you free dragon scales, but the chances are extremely low. PokeStops are symbolized by little blue box images on the map and usually can be observed in places of recreation such as a train station, a landmark, or even a regional post office. When your avatar is near to entering a PokeStop, the blue box image changes into a disc shape. The next thing you need to do is tap the disc, and it will exhibit a picture of the landmark, which is a chance to get a few free products.</p><p>You can get your hands on a dragon scale by spinning a specific Pokestop seven days in a row to get the required streak bonus. This won’t ensure you a dragon scale; however, it will give you the possibility of achieving other evolutionary objects such as the Sun Stone, Upgrade, Sinnoh Stone, Unova Stone, Metal Coat, and King’s Rock.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Specific Pokémon in Pokémon GO now call for rare evolution items such as a steel coat, a sunstone, a king’s rock, a dragon scale, or an upgrade to evolve, all of which are unplanned drops from Pokestops.

To win more matches and rank-up, players take the assistance of a Pokemon Go PvP tier list. With the help of a tier list, you can know what Pokemons to pick and identify some of the strongest contenders. In this post, I’m going to share dedicated Pokemon Go great, ultra, and master tier lists to help you pick the best Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-pvp-tier-list-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go pvp tier list banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-are-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-Lists-Evaluated"><a href="#Part-1-How-are-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-Lists-Evaluated" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How are Pokemon Go PvP Tier Lists Evaluated?"></a>Part 1: How are Pokemon Go PvP Tier Lists Evaluated?</h2><p>Before you go through our carefully calculated great, ultra, and master league Pokemon Go tier list, you should know some basics. Ideally, the following parameters are considered while placing any Pokemon in a tier list.</p><p><strong>Moves:</strong> The most important factor is the amount of damage any move can do. For instance, some moves like thunderbolt are more powerful than others.</p><p><strong>Pokemon type:</strong> The type of Pokemon also plays a vital role. You might already know that some Pokemon types can easily be countered while others have fewer counters.</p><p><strong>Updates:</strong> Niantic keeps updating Pokemon levels to have a balanced Pokemon Go PvP tier list. That’s why the current nerf or buff on any Pokemon would change their position in the list.</p><p><strong>CP levels:</strong> Since the three leagues have CP limits, the overall CP value of any Pokemon is also vital to place them in a tier list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-levels-pokemon-leagues.jpg"                      alt="cp levels pokemon leagues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-A-Complete-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-List-Great-Ultra-and-Master-Leagues"><a href="#Part-2-A-Complete-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-List-Great-Ultra-and-Master-Leagues" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Complete Pokemon Go PvP Tier List: Great, Ultra, and Master Leagues"></a>Part 2: A Complete Pokemon Go PvP Tier List: Great, Ultra, and Master Leagues</h2><p>Since Pokemon Go PvP matches are based on different leagues, I have also come up with Pokemon ultra, great, and master league tier lists to help you pick the most powerful Pokemon in every match.</p><h3 id="Pokemon-Go-Great-League-Tier-List"><a href="#Pokemon-Go-Great-League-Tier-List" class="headerlink" title="Pokemon Go Great League Tier List"></a>Pokemon Go Great League Tier List</h3><p>In Great League matches, the maximum CP of any Pokemon can be 1500.

Therefore, you can pick Tier 1 and 2 Pokemons and avoid the low-level Tier 4 and 5 Pokemons.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Tier 1 (5/5 rating)</td><td>Registeel and Giratina</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td>Tier 2 (4.5/5 rating)</td><td>Snorlax, Alolan Muk, Togekiss, Poliwrath, Gyarados, Steelix, and Blastoise</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 3 (4/5 rating)</td><td>Regice, Ho-Oh, Meltmetal, Suicune, Kingdra, Primeape, Cloyster, Kangaskhan, Golem, and Virizion</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 4 (3.5/5 rating)</td><td>Crustle, Glaceon, Piloswine, Latios, Jolteon, Sawk, Leafeon, Braviary, and Mesprit</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 5 (3/5 rating)</td><td>Celebi, Scyther, Latias, Alomomola, Durant, Hypno, Muk, and Roserade</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Pokemon-Go-Master-League-Tier-List"><a href="#Pokemon-Go-Master-League-Tier-List" class="headerlink" title="Pokemon Go Master League Tier List"></a>Pokemon Go Master League Tier List</h3><p>Lastly, in the Master League, we don’t have any CP limits for Pokemons.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.</p><p>There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned"></a>Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned</h2><p>The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind.

With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency.

Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.</p><p>The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.</p><p>Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.</p><h3 id="2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp"><a href="#2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp"></a>2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp</h3><p>There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account.

To increase your friendship level you need to battle and trade more and more. It’ll take quite a bit of time to reach that stature of a friendship level. This could cost as much as one million, this amount will however decrease with increasing friendship levels.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Trading in Pokemon go was introduced in recent times and had now become one of the most integral factors of the game.

These cadies are powerful and come with a lot of extra rewards. That said they are also very difficult to find, especially in Pokemon Fire Red. This article will show you some of the ways in which you can find Rare Cady, and level up quickly to improve your status in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?"></a>Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?</h2><p>All Pokemon Go game variations have Rare Candy, and they are mainly used to upgrade the level of any Pokemon by 1. If you were at level 9, you automatically go up to level 10, etc. This will save you from having to engage in battles to raise your level. You may also earn the level attacks that you would have earned at that level, even without having to fight.</p><p>There are a limited number of Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red. However, you can get unlimited Rare Candies by using Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candy cheat codes through GameShark or Action Replay. You may also get them through cloning your existing Rare Cady.</p><p>When you use a Rare Candy, you get enough Exp. Points to move to the next level. This means that it is best to use them for getting to the next level, especially when it becomes too challenging. Although you get to the next level, you will not earn any Effort Value Points, which will make your Pokemon weaker than it would have been if you had leveled up through training.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Rare-Candy-Cheat-Fire-Red-2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Rare Candy Trainer Card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-get-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-get-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to get rare candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red?"></a>Part 2: How to get rare candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red?</h2><p>There are three main ways in which you can get Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.</p><p>There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned"></a>Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned</h2><p>The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp"><a href="#Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp"></a>Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp</h2><p>Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency. Also, you can fake your personal details as it is a beta key.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-5.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Now, once you got the beta key, fill it in the login details to use the PGSharp. Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.</p><p>The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.</p><p>Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.</p><h3 id="2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp"><a href="#2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp"></a>2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp</h3><p>There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account. You should not use your main account to fake GPS with PGSharp. First, create a PTC account and then install PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go without a ban.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-6.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Also, make sure to uninstall the official account to spoof the location to help you catch more Pokémon in less time.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?"></a>Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?</h2><p>Spoofing on the iPhone is a little more difficult than on Android. So, if you own an iPhone, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to fake location.

Further, this app is 100% safe to install on the iPhone as it causes no threat to your device or data.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo"></iframe><p>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also saves you from a ban and doesn’t require jailbreaking the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. You can teleport to any location with it in seconds. Wondersahare specially designed it for iOS users and Android users, but the Pokemon GPS cheat is not available on Android.</p><p>To use it, you will need to install it on your device from the official site or click the “<em>Try It Free</em>“ button below directly. Once installed, connect your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to your computer and click on get the started icon. Now you have the world map-like interface where you can search for any desired location to spoof. So, all in all, it is very easy to use for a novice too. The best part is that it causes no ban like other unsafe spoofing apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Pokemon Go is a very interesting game and brings a lot of fun while playing.

To win more matches and rank-up, players take the assistance of a Pokemon Go PvP tier list. With the help of a tier list, you can know what Pokemons to pick and identify some of the strongest contenders. In this post, I’m going to share dedicated Pokemon Go great, ultra, and master tier lists to help you pick the best Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-pvp-tier-list-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go pvp tier list banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-are-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-Lists-Evaluated"><a href="#Part-1-How-are-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-Lists-Evaluated" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How are Pokemon Go PvP Tier Lists Evaluated?"></a>Part 1: How are Pokemon Go PvP Tier Lists Evaluated?</h2><p>Before you go through our carefully calculated great, ultra, and master league Pokemon Go tier list, you should know some basics. Ideally, the following parameters are considered while placing any Pokemon in a tier list.</p><p><strong>Moves:</strong> The most important factor is the amount of damage any move can do. For instance, some moves like thunderbolt are more powerful than others.</p><p><strong>Pokemon type:</strong> The type of Pokemon also plays a vital role. You might already know that some Pokemon types can easily be countered while others have fewer counters.</p><p><strong>Updates:</strong> Niantic keeps updating Pokemon levels to have a balanced Pokemon Go PvP tier list. That’s why the current nerf or buff on any Pokemon would change their position in the list.</p><p><strong>CP levels:</strong> Since the three leagues have CP limits, the overall CP value of any Pokemon is also vital to place them in a tier list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-levels-pokemon-leagues.jpg"                      alt="cp levels pokemon leagues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-A-Complete-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-List-Great-Ultra-and-Master-Leagues"><a href="#Part-2-A-Complete-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-List-Great-Ultra-and-Master-Leagues" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Complete Pokemon Go PvP Tier List: Great, Ultra, and Master Leagues"></a>Part 2: A Complete Pokemon Go PvP Tier List: Great, Ultra, and Master Leagues</h2><p>Since Pokemon Go PvP matches are based on different leagues, I have also come up with Pokemon ultra, great, and master league tier lists to help you pick the most powerful Pokemon in every match.</p><h3 id="Pokemon-Go-Great-League-Tier-List"><a href="#Pokemon-Go-Great-League-Tier-List" class="headerlink" title="Pokemon Go Great League Tier List"></a>Pokemon Go Great League Tier List</h3><p>In Great League matches, the maximum CP of any Pokemon can be 1500.

Therefore, you can pick Tier 1 and 2 Pokemons and avoid the low-level Tier 4 and 5 Pokemons.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Tier 1 (5/5 rating)</td><td>Registeel and Giratina</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td>Tier 2 (4.5/5 rating)</td><td>Snorlax, Alolan Muk, Togekiss, Poliwrath, Gyarados, Steelix, and Blastoise</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 3 (4/5 rating)</td><td>Regice, Ho-Oh, Meltmetal, Suicune, Kingdra, Primeape, Cloyster, Kangaskhan, Golem, and Virizion</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 4 (3.5/5 rating)</td><td>Crustle, Glaceon, Piloswine, Latios, Jolteon, Sawk, Leafeon, Braviary, and Mesprit</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 5 (3/5 rating)</td><td>Celebi, Scyther, Latias, Alomomola, Durant, Hypno, Muk, and Roserade</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Pokemon-Go-Master-League-Tier-List"><a href="#Pokemon-Go-Master-League-Tier-List" class="headerlink" title="Pokemon Go Master League Tier List"></a>Pokemon Go Master League Tier List</h3><p>Lastly, in the Master League, we don’t have any CP limits for Pokemons.

Evolving your Pokémon is how you advance through the game, level up, and become a better catcher.</p><p>Now, while some of your Pokémon in the game can evolve with the utmost ease, others require a bit more of a special touch, and that special touch comes in the form of evolution items. Necessary for certain species of Pokémon, evolution items can be somewhat elusive – one of the rarer ones being the Sun Stone.</p><p><strong>Pokémon Go Sun Stone evolutions</strong> can improve your entire in-game experience, so learn all about them below.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Sun-Stones-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Sun-Stones-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

You’ll most commonly get species-specific candy used for evolutions whenever you catch a specific Pokémon. Depending on the species, you’ll need more or less candy to evolve them. (And don’t worry, evolutions don’t affect the total number of Pokémon in your collection).</p><p>Depending on the specific Pokémon you want to evolve, you might need additional items or even need to perform a particular task. Some Pokémon will need to be walked as your Buddy Pokémon before they can evolve. Others can be evolved through trading them. Others can only evolve with the help of evolution items like the Sun Stone.</p><p>Pokémon Sun Stone evolutions will require you to collect the Sun Stone and a certain amount of candy (which can vary by Pokémon).</p><p>You can always check out how to evolve your Pokémon in your Pokédex.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Which-Pokemon-Evolve-With-Sun-Stones"><a href="#Part-3-Which-Pokemon-Evolve-With-Sun-Stones" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Of course, you can also increase your chances of encountering rare evolution items like the Sun Stone.</p><p>Pokémon Go will frequently have multiple special events happening every month.

Of course, you’ll always be generously rewarded for your efforts.</p><p>Among the different types of research the professor sends you is field research. You can collect your field research tasks by spinning the Photo Disc at a PokéStop. You can only collect and work on three field research tasks simultaneously, though a fourth one will open if you receive bonus research. Moreover, you and your friends can work together to complete the same field research if you all go to the same PokéStop on the same day.</p><p>As you’re completing your field research tasks, you can collect your rewards, earn stamps, and unlock breakthroughs. Hopefully, one of the rewards you receive will include the Sun Stone, allowing you to evolve some of your Pokémon.</p><h3 id="Special-Research"><a href="#Special-Research" class="headerlink" title="Special Research"></a>Special Research</h3><p>With field research, you have some flexibility. You can visit PokéStops when you’re up for them, and you can even discard some tasks if they’re too difficult for you. With special research, you don’t have all that much flexibility.</p><p>Professor Willow will contact you directly and give you specific tasks you must complete. You can’t disregard or discard them.</p><p>As a rule, special research will be more involved and will likely last longer than field research. However, your rewards will usually be much more valuable, and you’ll exponentially increase your chances of obtaining a Sun Stone.</p><h3 id="Gyms-and-PokeStops"><a href="#Gyms-and-PokeStops" class="headerlink" title="Gyms and PokeStops"></a>Gyms and PokeStops</h3><p>Of course, you can always earn valuable rewards by simply visiting gyms and PokéStops and spinning the Photo Discs. Create a 7-day PokéStop streak, as that will guarantee you’ll get an evolution item.</p><p>While you’ll usually get a more common evolution item after your 7-day streak, you might get a Sun Stone or something even more valuable.</p><p>Usually, it’s in your best interest to go to more popular areas with more PokéStops, as you’ll be able to make more spins faster.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Gather-Sun-Stones-Efficiently"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Gather-Sun-Stones-Efficiently" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

After all, Pokémon Go is a location-based game that requires you to go out into town and wander the streets of your city. There’s virtually no task you can complete from the comfort of your home unless you have an ace up your sleeve.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone virtual location can be a game-changer for completing your field research tasks quickly. A tool designed to spoof your location and make it seem like you’re out and about while you’re actually just relaxing at home, it can help you finish your field research without much fuss.</p><p>You can use the Dr. Fone virtual location to set your location to anywhere in the world. Create a one-stop or multi-stop route to make the game believe you’re moving around, or even use the jump-teleport mode to “transfer” to a more resource-rich location. However, be careful with the jump-teleport mode, as it can betray the fact that you’re using a location spoofer.</p><p>To get started with Wondershare Dr.Fone and complete your field research tasks, you must follow a few steps:</p><ol><li>Download and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer;</li><li>Connect your phone to your computer;</li><li>Go to <strong>Toolbox &gt; Virtual Location &gt; Get Started</strong>;</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="get started with wondershare dr.fone"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>On the map that shows up, click on <strong>No Device</strong>in the upper right-hand corner;</li><li>You’ll see a list of all connected devices, select your phone;</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-1.png"                      alt="choose the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you want to connect to dr.fone"                ></p><ol start="6"><li>On your phone, tap <strong>Allow USB Debugging</strong>;</li><li>On your phone, go to <strong>Developer Options&gt; Select mock location app</strong>;</li><li>Select <strong>Fone</strong>.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-3.png"                      alt="set up mock location on your phone"                ></p><p>From there, you can easily set up your route, change your location, and simulate movement.

Pokémon Go is a very active game with frequent high-rewarding events that could happen at any time. Since these events are time-limited, you’ll always want to know precisely when they start and end.</p><p>Fortunately, finding this out is pretty easy. Just keep track of Pokémon Go on social media or visit the official Pokémon Go website to find out more. All events will be announced ahead of time so that you can prepare.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Acquiring Sun Stones for Pokémon evolutions can be quite a hassle.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.</p><p>There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned"></a>Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned</h2><p>The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp"><a href="#Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp"></a>Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp</h2><p>Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency. Also, you can fake your personal details as it is a beta key.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-5.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Now, once you got the beta key, fill it in the login details to use the PGSharp. Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.</p><p>The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.</p><p>Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.</p><h3 id="2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp"><a href="#2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp"></a>2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp</h3><p>There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account. You should not use your main account to fake GPS with PGSharp. First, create a PTC account and then install PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go without a ban.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-6.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Also, make sure to uninstall the official account to spoof the location to help you catch more Pokémon in less time.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?"></a>Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?</h2><p>Spoofing on the iPhone is a little more difficult than on Android. So, if you own an iPhone, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to fake location. It is easy to use and easy to install. Further, this app is 100% safe to install on the iPhone as it causes no threat to your device or data.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo"></iframe><p>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also saves you from a ban and doesn’t require jailbreaking the Apple iPhone 15 device. You can teleport to any location with it in seconds. Wondersahare specially designed it for iOS users and Android users, but the Pokemon GPS cheat is not available on Android.</p><p>To use it, you will need to install it on your device from the official site or click the “<em>Try It Free</em>“ button below directly. Once installed, connect your Apple iPhone 15 to your computer and click on get the started icon. Now you have the world map-like interface where you can search for any desired location to spoof. So, all in all, it is very easy to use for a novice too. The best part is that it causes no ban like other unsafe spoofing apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Pokemon Go is a very interesting game and brings a lot of fun while playing. With reliable and trusted apps like PGsharp for android, you can spoof it without a ban. For iOS, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app is best for fake GPS without a ban.

These cadies are powerful and come with a lot of extra rewards. That said they are also very difficult to find, especially in Pokemon Fire Red. This article will show you some of the ways in which you can find Rare Cady, and level up quickly to improve your status in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?"></a>Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?</h2><p>All Pokemon Go game variations have Rare Candy, and they are mainly used to upgrade the level of any Pokemon by 1. If you were at level 9, you automatically go up to level 10, etc. This will save you from having to engage in battles to raise your level. You may also earn the level attacks that you would have earned at that level, even without having to fight.</p><p>There are a limited number of Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red. However, you can get unlimited Rare Candies by using Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candy cheat codes through GameShark or Action Replay. You may also get them through cloning your existing Rare Cady.</p><p>When you use a Rare Candy, you get enough Exp. Points to move to the next level. This means that it is best to use them for getting to the next level, especially when it becomes too challenging.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.</p><p>There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned"></a>Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned</h2><p>The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp"><a href="#Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp"></a>Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp</h2><p>Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency. Also, you can fake your personal details as it is a beta key.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-5.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Now, once you got the beta key, fill it in the login details to use the PGSharp. Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.</p><p>The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.</p><p>Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.</p><h3 id="2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp"><a href="#2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp"></a>2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp</h3><p>There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account. You should not use your main account to fake GPS with PGSharp. First, create a PTC account and then install PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go without a ban.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-6.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Also, make sure to uninstall the official account to spoof the location to help you catch more Pokémon in less time.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?"></a>Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?</h2><p>Spoofing on the iPhone is a little more difficult than on Android. So, if you own an iPhone, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to fake location. It is easy to use and easy to install. Further, this app is 100% safe to install on the iPhone as it causes no threat to your device or data.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo"></iframe><p>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also saves you from a ban and doesn’t require jailbreaking the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device. You can teleport to any location with it in seconds. Wondersahare specially designed it for iOS users and Android users, but the Pokemon GPS cheat is not available on Android.</p><p>To use it, you will need to install it on your device from the official site or click the “<em>Try It Free</em>“ button below directly. Once installed, connect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to your computer and click on get the started icon. Now you have the world map-like interface where you can search for any desired location to spoof. So, all in all, it is very easy to use for a novice too. The best part is that it causes no ban like other unsafe spoofing apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Pokemon Go is a very interesting game and brings a lot of fun while playing. With reliable and trusted apps like PGsharp for android, you can spoof it without a ban. For iOS, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app is best for fake GPS without a ban.

By far, it’s still the favorite in-game feature of many trainers all around the world. The reason is pretty obvious. You can collect tons of special rewards by doing nothing complicated other than following and completing a Route nearby. On top of that, Pokemon Go Routes can also be of great help if you’re searching for new walking paths around your location. Simply put, this particular addition to the game’s already amazing roster has many real-life and virtual benefits for the players.</p><p>However, it’s perhaps safe to say that Pokemon Go Routes is still far from perfect.
