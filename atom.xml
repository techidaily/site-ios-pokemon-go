Fixed"></a>Why is iPogo not working On Apple iPhone XS Max? Fixed</h2><p>The popular iPogo app is one of the best free apps you can use to spoof on your device while playing Pokémon Go. It is equipped with an abundance of features that allows players to get way ahead in the game by spotting spawns early, catching gym raids, discovering nests and quest events, and so on. If you spot a Pokémon which is way too far from your location, you can use iPogo to fake your virtual coordinates and trick Pokémon Go to think you are nearby that area. Sounds like an amazing app to use right? But, there is a downside to it too as users of the app have repeatedly reported of iPogo not working. The app seems to overload and malfunction after a few hours of repeated usage. This issue is preventing users from harnessing the full potential of their gaming experience.</p><h3 id="Why-Users-download-iPogo"><a href="#Why-Users-download-iPogo" class="headerlink" title="Why Users download iPogo?"></a>Why Users download iPogo?</h3><p>iPogo is a free to use Pokémon Go++ mod which can be downloaded as an APK file for your iOS devices. It features tools that can be used by players to play the game virtually anywhere in the world while also enhancing the gameplay experience. Few of these exclusive features have been mentioned in the list below;</p><ul><li>The Spin and Auto-cash feature can be used to capture Pokémon and throw a spinning ball without requiring a physical device.</li><li>With just one click you can manage your collection of stored items. It removes the cumbersome ordeal of the game to manually select and delete items when you can erase all un-required items with just one tap.</li><li>If you are on the hunt for special shiny Pokémon, you can do so without having to go through dozens of non-shiny one’s. On activating the Auto-Runaway feature on your iPogo, you can skip through the time consuming animations of all non-shiny Pokémon.</li><li>You can augment the game to let your avatar walk continuously at a desired pace. The speed of your avatar’s movement can be adjusted using iPogo.</li><li>If there are unnecessary elements crowding up your screen, you can hide them temporarily.</li><li>You keep track of Pokémon spawns, quests and raids using the feed on your iPogo.</li></ul><p>With all these amazing benefits at hand, it seems almost unfair to not be able to make the best of it if iPogo keeps crashing or stops working. Let’s look into the probable reasons why your iPogo is not working and explore methods to solve this dilemma.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-problem-that-iPogo-is-not-working"><a href="#Part-1-Common-problem-that-iPogo-is-not-working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working"></a>Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working</h2><p>Pokémon Go players have made several reports of how iPogo is not functioning normally on their devices. For instance, while using the Plus mod on Pokémon Go, the Apple iPhone XS Max device screen goes completely black and unresponsive making the game inaccessible. Also, devices that run Pokémon Go with iPogo seems to be running slower than those which do not use any helper or spoofing support.</p><p>Even if your device is able to withstand the load of using iPogo, it may still be possible to face other app related performance issues like ipogo enhanced-throw not working, ipogo joystick not working and ipogo feeds not working either. All these symptoms sums up the fact that the iPogo app is faltering on your device.</p><p>Read on to understand the reasons why your device is unable to run the iPogo mod smoothly;</p><ul><li>One of the root causes which explains why iPogo is crashing could be because you are utilizing too much of your phone’s system resource capacity. This means you have too many tabs or other applications opened on your device that is making the resource distribution falter leading to an automatic shutdown.</li><li>Another plausible reason could be that your iPogo application has not been properly installed. It is widely agreed upon that iPogo is a difficult app to install as it involves going through complex steps making it easier for mistakes to be made, eventually leading to a complete breakdown of the software.</li><li>Since installing iPogo is a cumbersome process, players would often resort to using downloading hacks to get the job done faster. However, not all such hacks can be relied upon as they may end up jail breaking your device or make your version of the app even more unstable.</li></ul><h3 id="Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue"><a href="#Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue" class="headerlink" title="Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue"></a>Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue</h3><p>It is often said that short cuts can cut you short or in this case, hacked! Disrupting the framework of your device is not price you should pay for enjoying the game at its best. Although, there are other safer and more reliable solutions to making the iPogo app run better on your iOS device. Let’s take a brief peak at some of them.</p><ul><li><strong>Limiting the usage of System Resources:</strong> Let’s keep in mind that it is unwise to keep too much on your plate and rightfully so. In this case, the more applications you keep active on your shortcut bar, the lesser resources your CPU has left to allocate to the iPogo app. Therefore, close off all other unnecessary applications before launching iPogo as it is already a heavy enough application to run on its own.</li><li><strong>Too many Items opened:</strong> Keep a tight check on your list of inventory while playing Pokémon Go using iPogo. Remember to delete all un-required collected items as it may be taking up too much space and wasting precious system resources.</li><li><strong>Keep you Device Clean:</strong> Not essentially in the literal sense but yes, it is indeed important to clean up your device often.

If you own an Android device, then you can simply use a GPS spoofing app to manually change the location of your device. This will trick Pokemon Go into believing that you are walking instead. For iPhone users, the feature would need a jailbroken device though.</p><p>While changing your location, make sure that you do it tactfully. For instance, if an egg would need 10 kilometers of walking, then change your location gradually instead of just switching it in one go. Here’s <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong> by using a GPS spoofer.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, unlock your Android phone and go to its Settings &gt; About Phone to tap the Build Number field 7 times.

Later, visit Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn it on. Also, allow mock locations on the phone and choose the installed app from here.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-3.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing app"                ></p></li><li><p>That’s it!

Most of the eggs in Pokemon Go would need you to walk 2, 5, or 10 kilometers. The good news is that an average drone can easily cover this distance. Firstly, get a working drone on which you can easily place your phone. It is recommended to get a lock so that your device won’t fall while it is on a drone. Once your phone is successfully attached to a drone, just use it to cover a substantial distance. Make sure that the speed is minimal so that Pokemon Go would believe that you are walking instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-5.jpg"                      alt="Play Pokemon Go with a drone"                ></p><p><strong>Things to Remember</strong></p><ul><li>While doing so, don’t forget about the safety of your phone as it can get stolen by someone if it goes too far.</li><li>Use a lock and make sure that your phone won’t fall from your drone.</li><li>Enable the Find My Apple iPhone XS service on your Android or iPhone so that you can locate your phone if it is lost.</li><li>Move your drone slowly so that Pokemon Go would not detect that you are using a drone or playing the game while driving.</li></ul><h2 id="Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users"><a href="#Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users" class="headerlink" title="Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users"></a>Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users</h2><p>A while back, Pokemon Go enabled the option to add friends on the app and send them gifts. Presently, we can send gifts to 20 other friends from our account in a day. Therefore, if you have a lot of friends, then you can send them eggs, including the exclusive 7 km egg. There are tons of online sources and forums for people to exchange their friend codes for Pokemon Go.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, Launch Pokemon Go on your phone and go to your profile.

There are all kinds of incubators available in the game that can help you hatch eggs without walking much.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, make sure that you have enough Pokecoins with you.

You can just place your phone carefully on your bike or skateboard and cover the needed distance to hatch more eggs. While you would still have to go out for this, the effort needed would be far less than walking.</p><p>Just make sure that you stay safe while riding your bike or skateboard. Don’t focus too much on catching new Pokemons. Instead, just cover the needed distance to hatch the egg. Also, ride your bike or skateboard slowly to make sure Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-10.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Bike or Skateboard"                ></p><h2 id="Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go"></a>Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you have a Roomba or any other robotic cleaner in the house, then you can also take its assistance to hack Pokemon Go eggs. All you got to do is place your phone on the Roomba and let it move around in your house. Since the robotic cleaner would move slowly, it will make Pokemon Go believe that you are walking instead. Just be sure that your phone will stay safe and protected.

It would be the replica of a big railroad with miniature trains. Simply place your phone on a miniature train and let it revolve around the railroad to cover the distance. Just keep your phone safe and regulate the speed of the train to make sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement. You would have to drive your train for a while to cover the distance, but you don’t have to walk to do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-12.jpg"                      alt="Model Railroad"                ></p><h2 id="Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go"></a>Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go</h2><p>Do you have a turntable?

This means that these Pokémon are exclusively locked in select regions around the world. Don’t Panic! You don’t have to spend a boat load of cash in order to catch these special regional Pokémon as there are tricks you can apply to catch them without even stepping out of your kitchen.</p><h2 id="Part-1-List-of-the-regional-Pokemon-that-have-been-announced"><a href="#Part-1-List-of-the-regional-Pokemon-that-have-been-announced" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced"></a>Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced</h2><p>Since the game publishers released these special regional Pokémon, they have been locked in their geo-specific locations around the world. There is a set or pair of regional Pokémon for each generation that has been introduced into the game. Regions may not be defined by real-time borders but are divided according to the type of the Pokémon and the place they are more likely to spawn.</p><p>These places may be specific to countries (Tauros spawn in the US), specific to a continent (Mr.Mime Spawn in Europe), specific to a region (Corsola spawn in the Tropics), and even certain halves of the planet (Lunastone and Solrock spawn in the Southern half and Northern half of the equator, respectively). These Pokémon are not necessarily rare spawn types. If you are traveling in their region, they may pop up quite frequently. You should take note that regional Pokémon won’t become available in Gyms or in Nests since they will only spawn in the wild. However, you can yet find them through eggs but only in their specific regions.</p><p>There are some exceptions among the regionals as well. These exceptions are known to swap their spawn locations or drop out of regional exclusivities like Zangoose and Seviper, or Minun and Plusle. Some regional Pokémon may also turn up in special in-game events like how Farfetch’d spawned during the 2017 Pokémon Go Travel Challenge.</p><p>If you are not a frequent traveler or know fellow trainers who are willing to trade their regional Pokémon then you may need to be patient and follow a few extra steps in order to get your hands on these rare types of Pokémon.</p><p>List of different Regional Pokémon – Where and How to Catch them All!</p><p>As of now, there are over 40 different regional Pokémon divided across generations that can be captured or hatched only in specific expanses of the world. There are of course occasional overlaps of Pokémon slipping out of their region and into other sectors. Let’s get into the list of all the region-specific Pokémon of different generations and where to find them.</p><h3 id="Gen-1-Kanto-Pokemon"><a href="#Gen-1-Kanto-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Gen 1&#x2F; Kanto Pokémon"></a>Gen 1&#x2F; Kanto Pokémon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/kanto-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="kanto pokemon"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Taouros:</strong> North America.</li><li><strong>Farfetch’d:</strong> Asia.</li><li><strong>Mr. Mime:</strong> Europe.</li><li><strong>Kangashkhan:</strong> Australia&#x2F;Pacific.</li></ul><h3 id="Gen-2-Johto-Pokemon"><a href="#Gen-2-Johto-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Gen 2&#x2F; Johto Pokémon"></a>Gen 2&#x2F; Johto Pokémon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/johto-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="johto pokemon"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Heracross:</strong> South America&#x2F; Southern Florida.</li><li><strong>Corsola:</strong> Equatorial Latitudes.</li></ul><h3 id="Gen-3-Hoenn-Pokemon"><a href="#Gen-3-Hoenn-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Gen 3&#x2F; Hoenn Pokémon"></a>Gen 3&#x2F; Hoenn Pokémon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/hoenn-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="hoenn pokemon"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Tropius:</strong> The Middle East and Africa.</li><li><strong>Torkoal:</strong> Southeast Asia.</li><li><strong>Volbeat:</strong> Europe, Australia, and Asia.</li><li><strong>Relicanth:</strong> The Cook Islands&#x2F;New Zealand.</li><li><strong>Solrock:</strong> Currently America and Africa.

Remember that Pokémon Go functions by tracking your location via GPS. Your GPS however, is a virtual means of tracking your IP address which can be faked using the right mock GPS and VPN. You can use a mock virtual location to fake your actual location and make it seem like you’re traveling around the world. The game itself would be tricked, allowing you to travel to regions and get your hands on those geo-exclusive Pokémon.</p><p>To get the best out of your mock location and also to avoid the risk of hitting a light ban on your account, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare has been reviewed as a Mock GPS you can easily rely on. It offers a number of features that can come in handy while faking your location such as adjusting the speed so that it may seem like you’re actually traveling, you can use a 360-degree virtual joystick for manual control over your movements and you can also select specific routes on the map on which you want your in-game avatar to move on.</p><h3 id="Step-by-Step-Tutorial"><a href="#Step-by-Step-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Step-by-Step Tutorial"></a>Step-by-Step Tutorial</h3><p>You can follow these easy steps to set up and access your Dr.Fone Virtual Location in an instant and teleport to anywhere in the world.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download the Program</strong></p><p>Download Dr.Fone – Virtual Location.

When they spawn near your location, you catch it by throwing a Poke ball at it. If the Poke ball is seen shaking, it means that the Pokémon is resisting and may just pop out from the ball in which case you may have to throw another one at it. Now, if you are traveling and you have limited time or a number of spawns then here are a few tips you can utilize to enhance your chances of landing a catch.</p><ul><li><strong>Curve Ball:</strong> Practice your curveball throws. Throwing a curve ball automatically increases your chances of preventing a Pokémon from slipping through your hands, plus you also get a 17x bonus with each successful curve catch.</li><li><strong>Maximize your Medals:</strong> Medals increase your performance in the game without costing you any extra resources like Great balls, Ultra Balls, or Razz Balls. So, try and max out your medals to increase your chances of catching rare Pokémon, especially the exclusive ones.</li><li><strong>Keep Consistent:</strong> The algorithm of the game is quite complex but eventually, a pattern emerges. You will notice that if you keep practicing with great or excellent catches with the smaller (low XP) Pokémon, it increases your chances of catching the ones that put up a fight.</li><li><strong>Save your Berries:</strong> Feeding a Pokémon with Razz Berries increases your assurances of catching the Pokémon while also giving you a 15x bonus when you land a successful catch. Save your berries for those persistent Pokémon spawns.</li><li><strong>Use Powerful Poke balls:</strong> Last but definitely not least, use powerful balls like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball to maximize your chances of catching Pokémon. You should also remember that these are diminishable resources so use them wisely. On catching a Pokémon with a Great ball you will get 15x and with an Ultra ball you would get 2x so utilize them accordingly to catch rare and super rare Pokémon.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The journey to completing your Pokedex may not be a short one as there are hundreds of Pokémon out there, and even hundreds more yet to be introduced into the game. Traveling the world in search of the rarest regional Pokémon is meant to be a fun and exciting experience, yet it may not be viable for some who wish to enjoy the game to the fullest. Utilizing a fake GPS and VPN can bridge the gaps in your Pokedex and keep the game fun for you at the same time. So keep playing and catching Pokémon as there are loads of other exciting installments yet to be introduced by Niantic in the future.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-essential-tips-for-hosting-a-successful-facebook-live-event/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Essential Tips for Hosting a Successful Facebook Live Event</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/which-pokemon-can-evolve-with-a-moon-stone-for-apple-iphone-6-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Which Pokémon can Evolve with a Moon Stone For Apple iPhone 6?

This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency.

You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account.

But sometimes iPogo can’t install, and users face a lot of difficulties. At that moment, some users feel furious and look forward to the solutions to get rid of it. If you also hit in the same category, you are on the right page. Let’s discuss it more and look forward to the solution that will help you to install it again.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-that-you-can’t-install-the-ipogo"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-that-you-can’t-install-the-ipogo" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons that you can’t install the ipogo"></a>Part 1: Reasons that you can’t install the ipogo</h2><p>There are multiple reasons that contribute to the difficulty when you can’t install the iPogo. Some of them are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>iPhone version:</strong></li></ul><p>The current iPhone version you are choosing may be responsible for the problem for iPogo can’t install. It is important to have iOS version 13. It works on all the known jailbreak devices having the same iOS. In case you have upgraded the iOS 13 to iOS 14, the chances are quite less to use it.</p><ul><li><strong>iPogo version:</strong></li></ul><p>iPogo version is also an important factor of consideration. Time to time regular updates keep coming, and if you are stuck on the previous version, you will not be able to use it. Sometimes the iPogo is down whenever there is an update, and when you try to update it, the problem arises. At that moment, you need to be patient and try re-installation.</p><ul><li><strong>Direct download method:</strong></li></ul><p>If a user is considering direct downloading method, they might also face this trouble because Apple now targets certificate. Now you need to create your certificate with the help of a computer or a paid service like Signulous and others.</p><h3 id="Bonus-Simple-steps-to-install-iPogo"><a href="#Bonus-Simple-steps-to-install-iPogo" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: Simple steps to install iPogo"></a>Bonus: Simple steps to install iPogo</h3><p>To install iPogo, we suggest you avoid the direct download method and instead follow the steps to follow with “Matrix installer.”</p><p><strong>Steps to follow:</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Upgrade the iTunes version of your computer to latest version.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now remove the original app from your iDevice.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Get IPA from the website download and save it.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Launch the “Matrix Installer”.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> With the help of USB cable connect your Apple iPhone XR to the PC.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Let the installer to detect the iDevice.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Now click on “Device” then “Install Package” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/ipogo-install-package.jpg"                      alt="ipogo install package"                ></p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Now the installer asks for the Apple ID username, and Password mentions the same.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.</p><p>There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned"></a>Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned</h2><p>The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp"><a href="#Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp"></a>Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp</h2><p>Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency. Also, you can fake your personal details as it is a beta key.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-5.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Now, once you got the beta key, fill it in the login details to use the PGSharp. Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.</p><p>The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.</p><p>Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.</p><h3 id="2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp"><a href="#2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp"></a>2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp</h3><p>There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account. You should not use your main account to fake GPS with PGSharp. First, create a PTC account and then install PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go without a ban.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-6.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Also, make sure to uninstall the official account to spoof the location to help you catch more Pokémon in less time.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?"></a>Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?</h2><p>Spoofing on the iPhone is a little more difficult than on Android. So, if you own an iPhone, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to fake location. It is easy to use and easy to install. Further, this app is 100% safe to install on the iPhone as it causes no threat to your device or data.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo"></iframe><p>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also saves you from a ban and doesn’t require jailbreaking the Apple iPhone X device. You can teleport to any location with it in seconds. Wondersahare specially designed it for iOS users and Android users, but the Pokemon GPS cheat is not available on Android.</p><p>To use it, you will need to install it on your device from the official site or click the “<em>Try It Free</em>“ button below directly. Once installed, connect your Apple iPhone X to your computer and click on get the started icon. Now you have the world map-like interface where you can search for any desired location to spoof. So, all in all, it is very easy to use for a novice too. The best part is that it causes no ban like other unsafe spoofing apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Pokemon Go is a very interesting game and brings a lot of fun while playing.

However, a much more interesting factor is PvP battles, where you can go head-to-head with other trainers. In this article, we are going to talk about why adding PvP battles is not just something we want but something we really need.</p><p>PvP battles are important for making the game more exciting and having some friendly competition. These battles will evaluate your skills and how well you know your Pokémon. We will provide you with some useful tips to win the league with the <strong>best PvP Pokémon</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/everything-to-know-about-pvp-1.jpg"                      alt="understanding more about pokemon pvp battles"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-the-Possible-Leagues-in-Pokemon-GO-PvP"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-the-Possible-Leagues-in-Pokemon-GO-PvP" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Are the Possible Leagues in Pokémon GO PvP"></a>Part 1. What Are the Possible Leagues in Pokémon GO PvP</h2><p>There are three core leagues in the trainer battles in Pokémon GO, namely Great, Ultra, and Master. Each of these leagues has its own CP limitation and comes in rotation during each season. So, you have to learn to battle in each of them to get seamless rewards. Let’s look at each of these leagues individually for a better understanding of the <strong>best Pokémon for PvP</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/everything-to-know-about-pvp-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon pvp battles"                ></p><h3 id="1-Great-League"><a href="#1-Great-League" class="headerlink" title="1. Great League"></a>1. Great League</h3><p>The Great League is the easiest league to jump into for beginners. Here, only Pokémon with 1,500 CP or less can join the battle. This low CP cap makes Pokémon with lower maximum CP shine, like Azumarill and Altaria. These Pokémon might not stand out in the other leagues, but in the Great League, they can dominate the battlefield.</p><h3 id="2-Ultra-League"><a href="#2-Ultra-League" class="headerlink" title="2. Ultra League"></a>2. Ultra League</h3><p>The next league that comes is Ultra League, which raises the CP cap to 2,500. Legendary Pokémon start making appearances here, with a focus on defensive power. Pokémon like Registeel and Cresselia excel in this league, but there are also many other Pokémon that hold their own valuable potential.</p><p>In the same way, Venusaur with Frenzy Plant and Swampert with Hydro Cannon are also popular choices in this league.</p><h3 id="3-Master-League"><a href="#3-Master-League" class="headerlink" title="3. Master League"></a>3. Master League</h3><p>The Master League removes all CP limits, allowing any Pokémon to jump into the action. Here, Trainers tend to lean towards Pokémon with high maximum CP. Pokémon like Groudon and Origin Forme Giratina are notable here, making them fit for any kind of battle.</p><p>Surprisingly, some Pokémon are not commonly picked for Raids, like Dialga and Altered Forme Giratina. However, they are powerful competitors and key contributors to the Master League.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Strongest-Pokemon-To-Use-in-Each-Pokemon-GO-PvP-League"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Strongest-Pokemon-To-Use-in-Each-Pokemon-GO-PvP-League" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

What Is the Strongest Pokémon To Use in Each Pokémon GO PvP League?</h2><p>As you already must know, there are various Pokémon with their own individual CP cap. To battle in a PvP league, you must choose Pokémon that fall under the CP cap of that league. In this section, we will discuss the strongest and <strong>best Pokémon for PvP Pokémon GO</strong>:</p><h3 id="1-Arceus-Fighting"><a href="#1-Arceus-Fighting" class="headerlink" title="1.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.</p><p>There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned"></a>Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned</h2><p>The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp"><a href="#Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp"></a>Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp</h2><p>Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency. Also, you can fake your personal details as it is a beta key.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-5.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Now, once you got the beta key, fill it in the login details to use the PGSharp. Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.</p><p>The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.</p><p>Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.</p><h3 id="2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp"><a href="#2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp"></a>2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp</h3><p>There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account. You should not use your main account to fake GPS with PGSharp. First, create a PTC account and then install PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go without a ban.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-6.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Also, make sure to uninstall the official account to spoof the location to help you catch more Pokémon in less time.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?"></a>Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?</h2><p>Spoofing on the iPhone is a little more difficult than on Android. So, if you own an iPhone, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to fake location.

You can teleport to any location with it in seconds. Wondersahare specially designed it for iOS users and Android users, but the Pokemon GPS cheat is not available on Android.</p><p>To use it, you will need to install it on your device from the official site or click the “<em>Try It Free</em>“ button below directly.

The best part is that it causes no ban like other unsafe spoofing apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Pokemon Go is a very interesting game and brings a lot of fun while playing.

Catching little cuddles and fighting to catch more-powerful Pokémon is really fun. In addition to fun, this game also increases your knowledge about the surrounding area and the diversity around your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-1.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>For example, if you want to catch the special characters or characters of another city, you have to that place. This is the only drawback for players.

Niantic always modifies the policies to catch the spoofers and to maintain the originality of the game.

By doing so, Niantic can’t catch you.</li><li>Never use a modified game or third-party client to catch Pokémon. You never know the client may be a worker in the developer’s office. Therefore, you will get caught easily.</li><li>You need to be very careful about your movement in the game. If you are using a fake GPS app, then make sure your movements are reasonable. It means do not switch long-distance locations in few hours or frequently. It is because this makes it unreal in Niantic radar and may cause you a problem.</li><li>Finally, do not root your Phone, be it Android or iPhone. It is because when you root your device, its security gets compromised, and it is easy to get data about your device’s fake location. And, your Pokémon Go account also can be at risk.</li></ul><p>Therefore, in order to catch special and maximum Pokémon, you do not need to cheat the game, only PGSharp is enough.

Since Pachirisu is a region-specific Pokemon, chances are that you might not see it spawning everywhere. Though, if you use the right Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, then you can easily locate it. In this post, I’m going to suggest some working Pachirisu regional maps so that you can catch this Pokemon like a pro.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Things-You-Should-Know-About-Pachirisu"><a href="#Part-1-Things-You-Should-Know-About-Pachirisu" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu"></a>Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu</h2><h3 id="What-are-Pokemon-GO-Pachirisu-Features"><a href="#What-are-Pokemon-GO-Pachirisu-Features" class="headerlink" title="What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?"></a>What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?</h3><p>Due to the many tinkles around Pachirisu, this part will delve into every detail of this Pokemon. It’s a squirrel-like creature that can glide after spreading its arms. This electric-type Pokemon is region-exclusive and only available in the Sinnoh region. The best moves of Pachirisu are Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, which are perfect for defense and offense.</p><p>It’s an EleSquirrel Pokemon that can win battles in rainy weather. Pachirisu is good against flying, steel, and electric-type Pokemon GO moves, whereas it is vulnerable to ground-type moves. This cute little guy would be an excellent pick in battles that can attack with fur balls.</p><p>You can evolve it into Mega Pachirisu with mega gems, but more evolution isn’t possible.

Mostly, it is observed that Pachirisu is spawned in the northern regions of Canada, Alaska, and Russia. You can find it in the wildering, electric hubs, parks, and even some colder regions. Since it can hide pretty well, you would have to keep a keen eye to look for it. A Pokemon Go regional map for Pachirisu can further help you.</p><h3 id="Are-there-Pachirisu-locations-with-coordinates"><a href="#Are-there-Pachirisu-locations-with-coordinates" class="headerlink" title="Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?"></a>Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?</h3><p>As introduced before, Pachirisu is primarily found in areas of Alaska, Canada, and certain parts of Russia. If you are in one of these regions, you have a chance to encounter and catch Pachirisu in the wild.</p><p>As for providing specific coordinates for Pachirisu locations, it is important to note that Pokémon spawns can change frequently and depend on various factors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide fixed coordinates for Pachirisu encounters as they can vary over time.</p><p>To increase your chances of finding Pachirisu, it is recommended to visit areas with a higher likelihood of spawning regional exclusives, such as parks, tourist attractions, or areas with a diverse range of Pokémon spawns. Additionally, participating in Pokémon Go events or connecting with local Pokémon Go communities can provide valuable information on Pachirisu sightings in your region.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Pachirisu-Pokemon-Go-Regional-Maps-to-Help-You"><a href="#Part-2-Pachirisu-Pokemon-Go-Regional-Maps-to-Help-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You"></a>Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You</h2><p>Since Pachirisu is mostly spawned in Alaska, Canada, and Russia, you might need to take some extra measures to locate it.

For that, you don’t have to go through any technical hassle or even jailbreak your device!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-inside-out-of-t5-ultimate-sports-and-adventures-recorder/"><u>[New] In 2024, Inside Out of T5  Ultimate Sports and Adventures Recorder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/in-2024-essential-voice-dampening-tech-a-list-of-the-top-10-tools/"><u>In 2024, Essential Voice Dampening Tech A List of the Top 10 Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/what-legendaries-are-in-pokemon-platinum-on-apple-iphone-x-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>What Legendaries Are In Pokemon Platinum On Apple iPhone X? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/what-pokemon-evolve-with-a-dawn-stone-for-apple-iphone-11-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>What Pokémon Evolve with A Dawn Stone For Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/what-legendaries-are-in-pokemon-platinum-on-apple-iphone-6-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>What Legendaries Are In Pokemon Platinum On Apple iPhone 6? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/what-pokemon-evolve-with-a-dawn-stone-for-apple-iphone-11-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>What Pokémon Evolve with A Dawn Stone For Apple iPhone 11? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/what-pokemon-evolve-with-a-dawn-stone-for-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>What Pokémon Evolve with A Dawn Stone For Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-budget-friendly-pc-screen-capture-software/"><u>In 2024, Budget-Friendly PC Screen Capture Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/what-legendaries-are-in-pokemon-platinum-on-apple-iphone-6-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>What Legendaries Are In Pokemon Platinum On Apple iPhone 6 Plus? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-webp-mastery-converting-to-jpeg/"><u>[New] In 2024, WebP Mastery  Converting to JPEG</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/what-pokemon-evolve-with-a-dawn-stone-for-apple-iphone-12-mini-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>What Pokémon Evolve with A Dawn Stone For Apple iPhone 12 mini? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/what-pokemon-evolve-with-a-dawn-stone-for-apple-iphone-13-mini-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>What Pokémon Evolve with A Dawn Stone For Apple iPhone 13 mini? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-sharefake-location-on-whatsapp-for-oppo-reno-8t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Share/Fake Location on WhatsApp for Oppo Reno 8T | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/interaction-system-friction/"><u>Interaction System Friction</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/what-legendaries-are-in-pokemon-platinum-on-apple-iphone-7-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>What Legendaries Are In Pokemon Platinum On Apple iPhone 7 Plus? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/what-legendaries-are-in-pokemon-platinum-on-apple-iphone-xs-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>What Legendaries Are In Pokemon Platinum On Apple iPhone XS Max? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-beyond-fun-and-games-deciphering-the-deep-meanings-in-emojis/"><u>[New] Beyond Fun & Games  Deciphering the Deep Meanings in Emojis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-compreran-yoga-moves-check-out-top-10-youtube-channels/"><u>[New] Compreran Yoga Moves?

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.</p><p>There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned"></a>Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned</h2><p>The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp"><a href="#Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp"></a>Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp</h2><p>Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency.

Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.</p><p>The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.</p><p>Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.</p><h3 id="2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp"><a href="#2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp"></a>2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp</h3><p>There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account.

These cadies are powerful and come with a lot of extra rewards. That said they are also very difficult to find, especially in Pokemon Fire Red. This article will show you some of the ways in which you can find Rare Cady, and level up quickly to improve your status in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?"></a>Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?</h2><p>All Pokemon Go game variations have Rare Candy, and they are mainly used to upgrade the level of any Pokemon by 1. If you were at level 9, you automatically go up to level 10, etc. This will save you from having to engage in battles to raise your level. You may also earn the level attacks that you would have earned at that level, even without having to fight.</p><p>There are a limited number of Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red. However, you can get unlimited Rare Candies by using Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candy cheat codes through GameShark or Action Replay. You may also get them through cloning your existing Rare Cady.</p><p>When you use a Rare Candy, you get enough Exp. Points to move to the next level. This means that it is best to use them for getting to the next level, especially when it becomes too challenging.

For instance, $0.99 would let you purchase 100 Pokecoins.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-8.jpeg"                      alt="get Pokecoins"                ></p></li><li><p>Great! Once you have enough Pokecoins, go to the Shop again and choose to buy eggs and incubators.</p></li><li><p>After getting enough incubators, you can go to your collection and apply more incubators to hatch eggs without walking.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-9.jpg"                      alt="apply more incubators"                ></p></li></ol><h2 id="Way-6-Make-Use-of-Your-Bike-or-Skateboard"><a href="#Way-6-Make-Use-of-Your-Bike-or-Skateboard" class="headerlink" title="Way 6: Make Use of Your Bike or Skateboard"></a>Way 6: Make Use of Your Bike or Skateboard</h2><p>This is one of the oldest tricks in the book to learn <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong>. You can just place your phone carefully on your bike or skateboard and cover the needed distance to hatch more eggs. While you would still have to go out for this, the effort needed would be far less than walking.</p><p>Just make sure that you stay safe while riding your bike or skateboard. Don’t focus too much on catching new Pokemons. Instead, just cover the needed distance to hatch the egg. Also, ride your bike or skateboard slowly to make sure Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-10.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Bike or Skateboard"                ></p><h2 id="Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go"></a>Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you have a Roomba or any other robotic cleaner in the house, then you can also take its assistance to hack Pokemon Go eggs. All you got to do is place your phone on the Roomba and let it move around in your house. Since the robotic cleaner would move slowly, it will make Pokemon Go believe that you are walking instead. Just be sure that your phone will stay safe and protected. I would recommend placing it in a waterproof lock to further protect it from any wear and tear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-11.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Roomba"                ></p><h2 id="Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go"></a>Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you are already into model railroads, then you won’t face any issues playing Pokemon Go. It would be the replica of a big railroad with miniature trains. Simply place your phone on a miniature train and let it revolve around the railroad to cover the distance. Just keep your phone safe and regulate the speed of the train to make sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement. You would have to drive your train for a while to cover the distance, but you don’t have to walk to do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-12.jpg"                      alt="Model Railroad"                ></p><h2 id="Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go"></a>Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go</h2><p>Do you have a turntable? If yes, you are lucky! You can use it that you used to listen to music to trick Pokemon Go that you’re walking and hatch the eggs. Because the turntable creates enough motion in a wide enough circle that it will trick your phone’s internal sensors into thinking you’re walking. This trick is for anyone who wants to be a quick hatch in Pokemon Go! Here are the steps:</p><p>Place your phone on the outermost edge of the turntable &gt; Turn on the turntable &gt; Confirm if your eggs are starting to hatch. If not, readjust your device and try again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking.jpg"                      alt="play pokemon go with turntable"                ></p><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Tired of walking to hatch eggs?

You can also use a Star Piece to multiply your winnings by 1.5.</p><p>Another method is to play with your friends, and the Stardust points can vary from 300 to 1000, depending on your opponent’s rank.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-3.jpg"                      alt="pvp in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Opening-Gifts"><a href="#By-Opening-Gifts" class="headerlink" title="By Opening Gifts"></a>By Opening Gifts</h3><p>Opening gifts is one of the main components of the Pokemon Go experience. You’ll get daily gifts you can open for free, earn valuable items, and support your gameplay. Each gift can carry a certain amount of Stardust particles, so you don’t have to do anything to accumulate these items.</p><p>The maximum Stardust you can get in one gift is 300, which may not seem like a lot. However, if you open your gifts regularly, you’ll have the desired Stardust amount in no time. You should also combine this method with others mentioned in this article for the best experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-4.jpg"                      alt="opening gifts in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Hatching-Pokemon"><a href="#By-Hatching-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="By Hatching Pokemon"></a>By Hatching Pokemon</h3><p>Hatching a Pokemon is also one of the essential parts of your Pokemon experience. Every time you hatch an egg, you’ll get Stardust points you can spend on numerous instances. The Stardust amount will depend on the egg itself; the higher the rank, the better the prices.</p><p>You can check out the list below to determine how much Stardust you’ll collect through your egg hatching:</p><ul><li>400–800 Stardust for hatching a 2km egg;</li><li>600–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 5km egg;</li><li>800–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 7km egg;</li><li>1600–3200 Stardust for hatching a 10km egg;</li><li>3200–6400 Stardust for hatching a 12km egg.</li></ul><p>You can also use the Star Piece item to multiply the Stardust amount by 1.5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-5.jpg"                      alt="eggs in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Catching-Pokemon"><a href="#By-Catching-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="By Catching Pokemon"></a>By Catching Pokemon</h3><p>Catching Pokemon is one of the most efficient ways of earning Stardust points. Each Pokemon has a base rate of 100 Stardust points, but you can earn more points depending on the Pokemon’s evolution stage. For instance, if the Pokemon is in the second stage, you’ll earn an additional 500 Stardust points.</p><p>Another thing you should look out for is specific Pokemon characters – some may carry more than 100 Stardust points as their base. For instance, you can get a whopping 2,100 Stardust points if you catch Audino, 950 for Garbodor, 1,000 for Chimecho, etc.</p><p>If you stay consistent and catch at least one Pokemon daily, you can get up to 9,000 Stardust points on the seventh day. Moreover, the first catch of the day will bring you an additional 1,800 points.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-6.jpg"                      alt="catch a pokemon"                ></p><h3 id="By-Claiming-Raid-Rewards"><a href="#By-Claiming-Raid-Rewards" class="headerlink" title="By Claiming Raid Rewards"></a>By Claiming Raid Rewards</h3><p>When the Boss enters your Gym, you may think it’s a stressful scenario. However, you should consider the bright side and fight to earn valuable rewards, such as Stardust points.</p><p>Once you and your team defeat the Boss, you can collect the prizes. You’ll win 1,000 Stardust points each time a Boss enters, even if it leaves the Gym without a fight.</p><p>If you defeat the boss, you’ll also get a chance to catch the Pokemon, which can bring you even more Stardust points!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-7.jpg"                      alt="a raid battle in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Getting-Rocket-Rewards"><a href="#By-Getting-Rocket-Rewards" class="headerlink" title="By Getting Rocket Rewards"></a>By Getting Rocket Rewards</h3><p>Rocket rewards are sets of items you get after fighting the Team Go Rocket. Each time you beat this criminal group, you’ll be rewarded with either 500 or 1,000 Stardust points, depending on whether you were fighting Grunt or Team Go Leader.</p><p>Additionally, if you ever face Giovanni, you’ll get 5,000 points for fighting and beating him.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-8.jpg"                      alt="rocket battle in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Earning-Research-Rewards-Through-Completed-Tasks"><a href="#By-Earning-Research-Rewards-Through-Completed-Tasks" class="headerlink" title="By Earning Research Rewards Through Completed Tasks"></a>By Earning Research Rewards Through Completed Tasks</h3><p>Each player will get their daily to-do list depending on their skill and game level. Once you enter the app, you can complete these daily tasks for Stardust points.</p><p>The amount of points you will win depends on the task’s difficulty and duration. However, you should complete all the daily tasks to accumulate as many consumables as possible.</p><p>For instance, if you’re on level 45, you can head to the Go Battle League 45 times to earn 4,500 Stardust points.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-9.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go research tasks"                ></p><h3 id="By-Visiting-the-Gym"><a href="#By-Visiting-the-Gym" class="headerlink" title="By Visiting the Gym"></a>By Visiting the Gym</h3><p>While on your daily walk in the Pokemon world, you should check out whether you can find some Gyms around you. If you do, stop by to hang around with some of the most precious Pokemon characters and give them a berry while you’re there.</p><p>You’ll earn 20 Stardust points for each berry you give a Pokemon. It may be the easiest way to earn and use these points for your experience. Plus, you’ll meet new characters and fully experience what the Pokemon world offers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-10.jpg"                      alt="giving berries to pokemon characters"                ></p><h3 id="Claim-Stardust-Quickly-in-Pokemon-Go-by-Using-Location-Spoofing"><a href="#Claim-Stardust-Quickly-in-Pokemon-Go-by-Using-Location-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Claim Stardust Quickly in Pokemon Go by Using Location Spoofing"></a>Claim Stardust Quickly in Pokemon Go by Using Location Spoofing</h3><p>If you live in a rural area and don’t get too many chances to walk around and catch Pokemon characters, you can use a classic trick of location spoofing. It will allow you to change your virtual location and wander the streets of another city to discover more Pokemon opportunities.</p><p>However, you’ll need a reliable tool to realize your Pokemon goals. One of the best options is Wondershare Dr. Fone, which provides a Virtual Location feature suitable for this quest. Aside from the obvious, you can use this application to manage your smartphone, recover data, and improve your overall smartphone experience.</p><p>Virtual Location will allow you to head to any city in the world, collect the rarest Pokemon characters, and earn the most Stardust points possible.

With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency.

You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account.

Some players could simply use “charged moves” repetitively without recharging. Thankfully Niantic is coming up with a fix.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-the-Go-battle-league-known-issues"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-the-Go-battle-league-known-issues" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are the Go battle league known issues?"></a>Part 1: What are the Go battle league known issues?</h2><p>Pokémon Go as a game, is constantly evolving to improve the trainer’s experience which involves finding issues and resolving them. Like all other games, the publisher always tries their best to make the user experience more enriching and fair for the users.</p><p>Season 1 of the Battle League’s had a severe bug that a handful of players exploited to rise to the leader board. After a player has lodged few fast moves, (number of fast moves required for each Pokémon to charge attack, varies) the trainer’s Pokémon can lodge a secondary yet stronger charged attack to deal more damage.</p><p>The bug in the series implied that a Pokémon – “Melmetal” is able to recharge their charge attack even while attacking with a “Charged” move, essentially making the trainer using the Pokémon invincible during a real battle.</p><p>Several trainers immediately tweeted this excruciating bug to Niantic requesting this issue to be resolved immediately, as a result Niantic had to freeze the leader board for that season.</p><p>Players when entering the Battle League are shown – Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available Right Now, and all matches that were in progress were not concluded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-1.jpg"                      alt="pokemon 1"                ></p><p>Thankfully, the issue has been resolved and trainers can get back into the league without any change in the previous features.</p><p>Here’s a set of few known issues in the game currently being investigated by Niantic, which we can hope to see resolved later on in the future;</p><ul><li><strong>Inconsistent Fast Attacks against Opponent Charged Attacks –</strong> Your fast attacks don’t land a direct hit when the opponent is throwing his Charged Attack.</li><li><strong>Fast Attacks are slower on Android –</strong> Most android users are experiencing slower fast attacks than iOS users. Niantic has addressed the issue and are awaiting more reports on the issue.</li><li><strong>Charged Attack Button doesn’t work when tapped -</strong> Occasionally after few uses, the Charged Attack button fails to respond when tapped resulting in slower attacks during matches.</li><li><strong>Go Battle wins are not counted –</strong> Some times, a Go battle win is not counted in the Go Battle League Set and remains unrecorded in the journal.</li><li><strong>Animation Glitch of the trainer throwing a Poke ball –</strong> A glitch occurs occasionally when the trainer avatar is seen throwing a Poke Ball repetitively.</li><li><strong>Disappearance of the Charged Attack and Switch Button –</strong> The button of the Charge Attack and the Switch Pokémon button would eventually disappear in-enabling the trainer to take any action during live battle.</li><li><strong>Next Battle tab not showing up on the Post-win Screen –</strong> After ending a match or winning a battle, the button for the ‘Next Battle’ option disappears from the Post-win screen.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Why-does-the-go-battle-not-available"><a href="#Part-2-Why-does-the-go-battle-not-available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why does the go battle not available?"></a>Part 2: Why does the go battle not available?</h2><p>It’s not new for an augmented reality game to have bugs that impede on the fun aspect of the game, but the recent development to Pokémon Go included an update trainers have been waiting for since its release in 2016.</p><p>Battle League is a brand new additional feature to the game that allows players to play PVP or one on one matches with other trainers. Ninantic introduced Battle tournaments to be played in three leagues – Great, Ultra and Master, that gives trainers the opportunity to compete and gain dominance over score board.</p><p>Pokémon Go is now exploring its roots with Pvp being a part of the original game franchise. We can hope to see the game evolve into a platform for global players to go head to head with each other.</p><p>The first season of Pokémon Go Battle League had to be temporarily frozen due to prevalence of broken code (a.k.a. – bug) that created a loophole allowing certain players and unfair advantage.</p><p>After attacking your opponent with a Charge move, the move set requires a brief time to recharge in order for the player to be able to use it again.</p><p>Few players with the assist of Melmetal (ground and steel type) could lodge constant fast attacks while also using Charge moves with no recharge time. This landed a handful these players to skyrocket to the leader board.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon 2"                ></p><p>After this issue was tweeted to the notice of the game publisher, Ninattic temporarily paused Battle League. Trainers while accessing the live tournament event would be notified with – “Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available” by the game.</p><p>Although this doesn’t mean that trainers wouldn’t be able to play practice matches or close proximity matches. Battle League presents itself as an event in the game which gives trainers the chance to earn bonuses and stardust.</p><p>Even so, Pokémon Go continues to resolve issues as they come along and this shows us how there is so much more to look forward to. Battle Leagues, since its debut has had 4 seasons till now and trainers are all pumped for Season 5.</p><p>Here’s a list of exciting updates that will be included in the upcoming season;</p><ul><li>At Rank 7 you will encounter a Legendary Pokémon on the Go Battle League battle tracks as similar to the Legendary Pokémon encountered in 5star raids.</li><li>To reach Rank 2 a trainer will need to complete a number of Battles in order to progress.</li><li>From Rank 3 all the way to Rank 10, a higher number of battles must be won to proceed.</li><li>Season 5 will be completed once you reach rank 7 which will earn you the Elite Charged TM rather than an Elite Fast TM.</li><li>In Season 5 few Pokémon’s will get new updated move sets which the trainers can use to train and prepare for upcoming tournaments.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-you-want-to-level-up-your-pokemon-go"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-you-want-to-level-up-your-pokemon-go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Tips you want to level up your pokemon go?"></a>Part 3: Tips you want to level up your pokemon go?</h2><p>The basics you need to learn to play Pokémon go is catching Pokémon and powering them up.

It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.</p><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.</p><p>The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.</p><p>The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work"><a href="#Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?"></a>Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?</h2><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.</p><p>The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.</p><p><strong>958D8046<br>A7151D70<br>8BB602F7<br>8CEB681A.</strong></p><p>All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.</p><p>If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.</p><p>You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.</p><p>When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:<br><strong>82005274 0001</strong></p><p>You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”.

This enables you to quickly come back to this point should anything go wrong when trying to use the cheat codes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-1.jpg"                      alt="Save the game state"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2 –</strong> Now hit the “Cheats” menu and then choose the “Cheat List”.

All you have to do is go up to the register and then buy a Pokéball, and you will get a Master Ball instead, without having to pay a dime.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-4.jpg"                      alt="Enter PokeMart to but Pokémon Emerald Master Balls"                ></p><p>Only one Master Ball can be bought at a time, but you can do this as many times as you want.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Here you will learn about how to defeat this monster and how to find him.

How to Find the Giovani in Pokemon"></a>Part 1. How to Find the Giovani in Pokemon</h2><p>Locating Giovani’s hideout is never a walk in the park as you need to complete some daunting tasks. A detailed explanation of each task is given below:</p><h3 id="1-A-Troubling-Situation-Task"><a href="#1-A-Troubling-Situation-Task" class="headerlink" title="1. A Troubling Situation Task"></a>1. A Troubling Situation Task</h3><p>This four-step storyline Special Research task introduces players to the Team Go Rocket Invasion and Shadow Pokemon feature in the Pokemon Go game. Players leverage the task to learn how to stop the Team Go Rocket crime syndicate by reclaiming PokeStop and then purifying Shadow Pokemon.</p><p>How to Complete ’A Troubling Situation’ Task in Pokemon Go Giovani</p><p>Below you will find all the four steps you need to complete in the ‘A Troubling Situation’ task with their rewards:</p><p><strong>Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 1</strong></p><p>This step should be completed with ease since you aren’t new to the Giovani Pokemon Go game. Just evolve any two Pokemon that you own and then charge them up five times. And boom! You are done with this step.</p><p><strong>Reward:</strong> 1,000 Stardust and 2,000 XP</p><p><strong>Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 2</strong></p><p>For this step, you have to catch two shadow Pokemon which can be achieved by defeating two Grunts from Team Go Rocket. On killing them, they will leave some shadow Pokemon behind which you have to catch. After that, go ahead and defeat the last Grunt to complete this step.</p><p><strong>Reward:</strong> 2,000 Stardust, 2,000 XP, and 5 Golden Razz Berries</p><p><strong>Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 3</strong></p><p>After catching the shadow Pokemon in step 2, you need to catch one more to cleanse or purify the three of them. To do this, just tap on your shadow Pokemon, and then hit the Purify option. You will be charged some thousands of Stardust and a couple of candy for the shadow Pokemon.</p><p><strong>Rewards:</strong> 2000 Stardust, 5 Silver Pinap Berries, and 1 Rare Candy</p><p><strong>Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 4</strong></p><p>For this step, you’ve got nothing to do. All three objectives have been automatically completed for you when you finished the previous step. You only get rewards at this final step.</p><p><strong>Rewards:</strong> One Fast TM, One Charged TM, and 3 Rare Candies</p><h3 id="2-Giovani-Special-Research-Task"><a href="#2-Giovani-Special-Research-Task" class="headerlink" title="2. Giovani Special Research Task"></a>2. Giovani Special Research Task</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/giovani-special-research.jpg"                      alt="giovani special research"                ></p><p>After completing the quest above, Giovani Special Research or Looming in the Shadows is the next and final quest you have to complete to face Giovani. It’s a six-step Special Research that introduces the Team Go Rocket Grunts and Leaders: Cliff, Arlo, and Sierra.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/a-troubling-situation-task.jpg"                      alt="a troubling situation task"                ></p><p>On completing one research step, you will be given a reward called the Super Rocket Radar. Like the Rocket Radar, the Super Rocket Radar can be equipped and unequipped from your Bag. This reward doesn’t only show Giovani’s hideout, it also shows some of his Grunts hideouts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-does-the-Pokemon-Go-Giovani-Counter-Contain"><a href="#Part-2-What-does-the-Pokemon-Go-Giovani-Counter-Contain" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What does the Pokemon Go Giovani Counter Contain?"></a>Part 2. What does the Pokemon Go Giovani Counter Contain?</h2><p>Giovani remains the toughest beast amongst all the Team Go Rocket Leaders. When you find him in the game, be prepared to face his wrath. To defeat him, you need a powerful team.</p><p>The big boss choice of legendary Shadow Pokemon and second party members changes every month- the Pokemon you fought against the previous month will be different from that of the present month and thereafter.</p><p>Giovani’s lineup of creatures for October 2022 is shown below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Lineup of Creature</th><th>Pokemon</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>First</td><td>Persian</td></tr><tr><td>Second</td><td>Kangashkan, Nidoking, Garchomp</td></tr><tr><td>Third</td><td>Mewtwo</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For the Pokemon, Persian, and Kangashkan, try to have a Lucario, Conkeldurr, or Machamp in your team and you are good to defeat them.</p><p>When you encounter Nidoking or Garchomp, your team has to change. You will need to have a strong ice-type Pokemon on your team. The reason is that this new Lineup of creatures is strong on land and could cause substantial damage to the dragon-type Pokemon in case you wanna choose them.</p><p>Picking any of these great ice-type Pokemon, Mamoswine, Glaceon, or Weavile when you face Nidoking or Garchomp is a perfect choice. However, we recommend Mamoswine, because he isn’t just an ice-type Pokemon but also a strong ground-type Pokemon.</p><p>Once you defeat Team Go Rocket’s second lineup creatures, you will have to battle against the legendary psychic Pokemon, Mewtwo, who is weak to this set of Pokemon; bug, ghost, and Dark-type Pokemon. So beating this Pokemon Go Giovani grunt shouldn’t be a tedious task as you’ve got a plethora of choices when deciding the Pokemon-type to use. Origin Giratina and Tyranitar are some strong Dark-type Pokemon you can use to defeat Mewtwo.</p><p>Now you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against each lineup of creatures, leverage it to advance to the next phase of the game where you will face the big bad boss himself, Giovani.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Beat-Giovani-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Beat-Giovani-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

In most of the spoofing tools for Pokemon Go, the following features are offered.</p><ul><li>Users can directly spoof their location on Pokemon Go to anywhere they like in the world.</li><li>They can also simulate the movement of their device (and the trainer) using the inbuilt joystick.</li><li>The Pokemon Go Joystick APK can also let you set up a preferred speed for walking, jogging, or running.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Joystick"                ></p><p>Therefore, with the help of a Pokemon Go hack APK like this, players don’t have to leave their house to catch Pokemons. They can also participate in raids to hatch eggs from the comfort of their home.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Playing-Pokemon-Go-with-a-Joystick"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Playing-Pokemon-Go-with-a-Joystick" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?"></a><strong>Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?</strong></h2><p>There are several reasons why Pokemon Go joystick iOS&#x2F;Android hacks are so popular. After all, they give us the convenience to play our favorite game without breaking a sweat. Here are some of the major reasons why Pokemon Go joystick hacks are becoming so popular:</p><ul><li><p>Stay Safe Indoors</p><p>  Since we are in the middle of a global pandemic, it is not recommended to go out to explore Pokemons. Besides that, your neighborhood might not be safe or there could be unfavorable weather conditions outside. Therefore, you can consider using a Pokemon Go joystick to catch Pokemons without compromising your safety.</p></li><li><p>Move Beyond your Area</p><p>  If you are in a rural area, then chances are that there could be limited spawning locations for Pokemons. With a fake GPS Pokemon Go app, you can spoof your location to any major city.</p></li><li><p>Catch More Pokemons</p><p>  One of the major benefits of using a Pokemon Go spoofer APK is that we can easily catch tons of Pokemons without exploring any area. Just enter the exact spawning location of the Pokemon and catch it!</p></li><li><p>Level-up in the Game Easily</p><p>  From participating in raids to hatching eggs faster, there are so many other things that you can do with a Pokemon Go joystick.</p></li><li><p>Have a Better Gaming Experience</p><p>  Overall, a Pokemon Go spoofing iOS&#x2F;Android solution will provide tons of add-on features that would improve your gaming experience.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-What-are-the-Risks-of-Using-Pokemon-Go-Joysticks"><a href="#Part-3-What-are-the-Risks-of-Using-Pokemon-Go-Joysticks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?"></a><strong>Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?</strong></h2><p>While there are numerous benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick, its constant use can also backfire in the long run.</p><ul><li><p>Account Ban by Niantic</p><p>  Ideally, you should know that the use of any third-party service (like a fake GPS Pokemon Go hack) is against the terms and conditions of the game. At first, if Niantic will detect its use, then it will simply display a warning message. Though, after several warning messages, if your account is still flagged, then it can get permanently banned.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-3.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Account Ban"                ></p><p>  To avoid the banning of your Pokemon Go account, you can consider a “cooldown duration”. This simply suggests waiting for a specific duration before changing your location in the game.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-4.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Cooldown Duration"                ></p></li><li><p>Software Hack on Jailbroken Devices</p><p>  To use a Pokemon Go joystick iOS hack, you might have to jailbreak your device. This can even null the warranty of your device and would make it susceptible to security threats. You might already know that a jailbroken device can easily be corrupted by the spoofer or any other app.</p></li><li><p>The Pokemon Go Spoofing Company Might Shut Down</p><p>  Chances are that the Pokemon Go spoofing solution that you have purchased might go out of business. For instance, iSpoofer (an iOS fake GPS tool) is no longer functioning and its existing users can’t even reach out to its customer support after getting their account banned. That’s why it is highly recommended to only pick a reliable Pokemon Go joystick solution.</p></li></ul><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>As you can see, picking a reliable Pokemon Go joystick is the most important thing to play the game remotely. Therefore, I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as the application is extremely easy to use and will meet all your Pokemon Go location spoofing needs. The best part is that you don’t even need to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to spoof its location using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location.</p><ul><li>Users can instantly spoof their location on Pokemon Go to anywhere they like by entering the exact coordinates or its address.</li><li>It also has dedicated one-stop and multi-stop modes that would let you set up a route to simulate the movement of your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.</li><li>If you want, you can even enter the preferred speed for the simulated movement or the number of times to cover it.</li><li>The application will display a dedicated GPS joystick, letting you move realistically on the map.</li><li>There is also an option to mark certain routes as favorites or import&#x2F;export routes as GPX files.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-15.png"                      alt="virtual location"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I hope that after following this guide, you would be able to know more about the fake GPS Pokemon Go hacks.

Using it, you can catch any Pokemon remotely from the comfort of your home without jailbreaking your device.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/the-most-useful-tips-for-pokemon-go-ultra-league-on-apple-iphone-13-mini-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>The Most Useful Tips for Pokemon Go Ultra League On Apple iPhone 13 mini | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/the-most-useful-tips-for-pokemon-go-ultra-league-on-apple-iphone-12-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>The Most Useful Tips for Pokemon Go Ultra League On Apple iPhone 12 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-from-zero-to-hero-on-instagram-top-5-tips-with-examples-from-elites-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] From Zero to Hero on Instagram  Top 5 Tips with Examples From Elites for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/the-most-useful-tips-for-pokemon-go-ultra-league-on-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>The Most Useful Tips for Pokemon Go Ultra League On Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/the-most-useful-tips-for-pokemon-go-ultra-league-on-apple-iphone-14-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>The Most Useful Tips for Pokemon Go Ultra League On Apple iPhone 14 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/the-most-useful-tips-for-pokemon-go-ultra-league-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>The Most Useful Tips for Pokemon Go Ultra League On Apple iPhone 11 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/the-most-useful-tips-for-pokemon-go-ultra-league-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>The Most Useful Tips for Pokemon Go Ultra League On Apple iPhone 13 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/the-most-useful-tips-for-pokemon-go-ultra-league-on-apple-iphone-14-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>The Most Useful Tips for Pokemon Go Ultra League On Apple iPhone 14 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-mirror-your-realme-gt-5-screen-to-pc-with-chromecast-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Mirror Your Realme GT 5 Screen to PC with Chromecast | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/the-most-useful-tips-for-pokemon-go-ultra-league-on-apple-iphone-8-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>The Most Useful Tips for Pokemon Go Ultra League On Apple iPhone 8 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/the-most-useful-tips-for-pokemon-go-ultra-league-on-apple-iphone-se-2020-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>The Most Useful Tips for Pokemon Go Ultra League On Apple iPhone SE (2020) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/the-most-useful-tips-for-pokemon-go-ultra-league-on-apple-iphone-7-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>The Most Useful Tips for Pokemon Go Ultra League On Apple iPhone 7 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/cutting-edge-techniques-for-fast-facebook-image-assembly/"><u>Cutting-Edge Techniques for Fast Facebook Image Assembly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/the-most-useful-tips-for-pokemon-go-ultra-league-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>The Most Useful Tips for Pokemon Go Ultra League On Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-pioneering-video-tech-s-camera-race/"><u>2024 Approved  Pioneering Video Tech 'S Camera Race</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/superior-wireless-or-hardwired-optimal-gaming-connections/"><u>Superior Wireless or Hardwired?

This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency.

Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.</p><p>The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.</p><p>Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.</p><h3 id="2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp"><a href="#2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp"></a>2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp</h3><p>There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account.

You can evolve several pokemons just by trading them. There are several pokemon that you can evolve using trading. Given below is the list of the different pokemon that can benefit from evolution.</p><ul><li>Kadabra</li><li>Machoke</li><li>Graveler</li><li>Haunter</li><li>Boldore</li><li>Gurdurr</li><li>Karrablast</li><li>Shelmet</li></ul><p>However, trading Pokemons in Pokemon go could be slightly tricky without having at least one close friend in the games who is also of a considerable level. Only then, you will be able to evolve your pokemon by trading.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-do-the-special-trade"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-do-the-special-trade" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to do the special trade?"></a>Part 3: How to do the special trade?</h2><p>You need a Special Trade whenever you wish to trade a legendary Pokemon or a shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Go. These pokemon are very rare to find and hence you won’t want to trade these rare Pokemons very often, however, you can trade a rare Pokemon only once per day. To trade a rare Pokemon would also need to be a Great or Best friend, two of the highest levels of friendship in the game Pokemon go. To increase your friendship level you need to battle and trade more and more. It’ll take quite a bit of time to reach that stature of a friendship level. This could cost as much as one million, this amount will however decrease with increasing friendship levels.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Trading in Pokemon go was introduced in recent times and had now become one of the most integral factors of the game. Pokemon go trading has changed the gaming trend. However, you could get an upper hand by using a virtual location changer such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This can help you to even trade pokemons seamlessly with friends staying at far-off places. Using the pokemon trade feature and evolving pokemons is a smart and handy way to progress further in the game.

These cadies are powerful and come with a lot of extra rewards. That said they are also very difficult to find, especially in Pokemon Fire Red. This article will show you some of the ways in which you can find Rare Cady, and level up quickly to improve your status in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?"></a>Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?</h2><p>All Pokemon Go game variations have Rare Candy, and they are mainly used to upgrade the level of any Pokemon by 1. If you were at level 9, you automatically go up to level 10, etc. This will save you from having to engage in battles to raise your level. You may also earn the level attacks that you would have earned at that level, even without having to fight.</p><p>There are a limited number of Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red. However, you can get unlimited Rare Candies by using Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candy cheat codes through GameShark or Action Replay. You may also get them through cloning your existing Rare Cady.</p><p>When you use a Rare Candy, you get enough Exp. Points to move to the next level. This means that it is best to use them for getting to the next level, especially when it becomes too challenging. Although you get to the next level, you will not earn any Effort Value Points, which will make your Pokemon weaker than it would have been if you had leveled up through training.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Rare-Candy-Cheat-Fire-Red-2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Rare Candy Trainer Card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-get-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-get-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to get rare candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red?"></a>Part 2: How to get rare candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red?</h2><p>There are three main ways in which you can get Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red.

It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.</p><p>The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html" >spoof Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.</p><p>There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Pokemon-Go-Account-Get-Banned" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned"></a>Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned</h2><p>The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ban"                ></p><p>The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:</p><ul><li>Engaging in harassment against any player in the game</li><li>Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go</li><li>Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo</li><li>Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations</li></ul><p>If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp"><a href="#Part-2-Thumb-Rule-for-spoofing-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp"></a>Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp</h2><p>Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.</p><p>Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.</p><p>Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.</p><h3 id="2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban"><a href="#2-1-Spoof-Pokemon-with-PGSharp-without-a-ban" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban"></a>2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban</h3><p>To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.</p><p>Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp plan"                ></p><p>To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency. Also, you can fake your personal details as it is a beta key.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-5.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Now, once you got the beta key, fill it in the login details to use the PGSharp. Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.</p><p>The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.</p><p>Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.</p><h3 id="2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp"><a href="#2-2-Maximum-Safe-Distance-to-Teleport-with-PGSharp" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp"></a>2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp</h3><p>There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.</p><p>But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-Spoof-On-My-Main-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?"></a>Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?</h2><p>Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account. You should not use your main account to fake GPS with PGSharp. First, create a PTC account and then install PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go without a ban.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-6.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Also, make sure to uninstall the official account to spoof the location to help you catch more Pokémon in less time.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Part-4-Why-Opt-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?"></a>Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?</h2><p>Spoofing on the iPhone is a little more difficult than on Android. So, if you own an iPhone, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to fake location. It is easy to use and easy to install. Further, this app is 100% safe to install on the iPhone as it causes no threat to your device or data.</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo"></iframe><p>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also saves you from a ban and doesn’t require jailbreaking the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. You can teleport to any location with it in seconds. Wondersahare specially designed it for iOS users and Android users, but the Pokemon GPS cheat is not available on Android.</p><p>To use it, you will need to install it on your device from the official site or click the “<em>Try It Free</em>“ button below directly. Once installed, connect your Apple iPhone 15 Plus to your computer and click on get the started icon. Now you have the world map-like interface where you can search for any desired location to spoof. So, all in all, it is very easy to use for a novice too. The best part is that it causes no ban like other unsafe spoofing apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/11/pgsharp-ban.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Pokemon Go is a very interesting game and brings a lot of fun while playing. With reliable and trusted apps like PGsharp for android, you can spoof it without a ban. For iOS, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app is best for fake GPS without a ban.

To win more matches and rank-up, players take the assistance of a Pokemon Go PvP tier list. With the help of a tier list, you can know what Pokemons to pick and identify some of the strongest contenders. In this post, I’m going to share dedicated Pokemon Go great, ultra, and master tier lists to help you pick the best Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-pvp-tier-list-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go pvp tier list banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-are-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-Lists-Evaluated"><a href="#Part-1-How-are-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-Lists-Evaluated" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How are Pokemon Go PvP Tier Lists Evaluated?"></a>Part 1: How are Pokemon Go PvP Tier Lists Evaluated?</h2><p>Before you go through our carefully calculated great, ultra, and master league Pokemon Go tier list, you should know some basics. Ideally, the following parameters are considered while placing any Pokemon in a tier list.</p><p><strong>Moves:</strong> The most important factor is the amount of damage any move can do. For instance, some moves like thunderbolt are more powerful than others.</p><p><strong>Pokemon type:</strong> The type of Pokemon also plays a vital role. You might already know that some Pokemon types can easily be countered while others have fewer counters.</p><p><strong>Updates:</strong> Niantic keeps updating Pokemon levels to have a balanced Pokemon Go PvP tier list. That’s why the current nerf or buff on any Pokemon would change their position in the list.</p><p><strong>CP levels:</strong> Since the three leagues have CP limits, the overall CP value of any Pokemon is also vital to place them in a tier list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-levels-pokemon-leagues.jpg"                      alt="cp levels pokemon leagues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-A-Complete-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-List-Great-Ultra-and-Master-Leagues"><a href="#Part-2-A-Complete-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-List-Great-Ultra-and-Master-Leagues" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Complete Pokemon Go PvP Tier List: Great, Ultra, and Master Leagues"></a>Part 2: A Complete Pokemon Go PvP Tier List: Great, Ultra, and Master Leagues</h2><p>Since Pokemon Go PvP matches are based on different leagues, I have also come up with Pokemon ultra, great, and master league tier lists to help you pick the most powerful Pokemon in every match.</p><h3 id="Pokemon-Go-Great-League-Tier-List"><a href="#Pokemon-Go-Great-League-Tier-List" class="headerlink" title="Pokemon Go Great League Tier List"></a>Pokemon Go Great League Tier List</h3><p>In Great League matches, the maximum CP of any Pokemon can be 1500. Considering this in mind, I have picked the following Pokemons from tier 1 (most powerful) to tier 5 (least powerful).</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Tier 1 (5/5 rating)</td><td>Altaria, Skarmory, Azumarill, and Glarian Stunfisk</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td>Tier 2 (4.5/5 rating)</td><td>Umbreon, Swampert, Lanturn, Stunfisk, Dexoxys, Venusaur, Haunter, Jirachi, Lapras, Mew, and Whiscash</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 3 (4/5 rating)</td><td>Ivysaur, Uxie, Alolan Ninetales, Scrafty, Mawile, Wigglytuff, Clefable, Marshtomp, and Skuntank</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 4 (3.5/5 rating)</td><td>Qwilfish, Dustox, Glalie, Raichu, Dusclops, Serperior, Minun, Chandelure, Venomoth, Bayleef, and Golbat</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 5 (3/5 rating)</td><td>Pidgeot, Slowking, Garchomp, Golduck, Entei, Crobat, Jolteon, Duosion, Buterfree, and Sandslash</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Pokemon-Go-Ultra-League-Tier-List"><a href="#Pokemon-Go-Ultra-League-Tier-List" class="headerlink" title="Pokemon Go Ultra League Tier List"></a>Pokemon Go Ultra League Tier List</h3><p>You might already know that in the ultra league, we are allowed to pick Pokemons of up to 2500 CP. Therefore, you can pick Tier 1 and 2 Pokemons and avoid the low-level Tier 4 and 5 Pokemons.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Tier 1 (5/5 rating)</td><td>Registeel and Giratina</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td>Tier 2 (4.5/5 rating)</td><td>Snorlax, Alolan Muk, Togekiss, Poliwrath, Gyarados, Steelix, and Blastoise</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 3 (4/5 rating)</td><td>Regice, Ho-Oh, Meltmetal, Suicune, Kingdra, Primeape, Cloyster, Kangaskhan, Golem, and Virizion</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 4 (3.5/5 rating)</td><td>Crustle, Glaceon, Piloswine, Latios, Jolteon, Sawk, Leafeon, Braviary, and Mesprit</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 5 (3/5 rating)</td><td>Celebi, Scyther, Latias, Alomomola, Durant, Hypno, Muk, and Roserade</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Pokemon-Go-Master-League-Tier-List"><a href="#Pokemon-Go-Master-League-Tier-List" class="headerlink" title="Pokemon Go Master League Tier List"></a>Pokemon Go Master League Tier List</h3><p>Lastly, in the Master League, we don’t have any CP limits for Pokemons.

Evolving your Pokémon is how you advance through the game, level up, and become a better catcher.</p><p>Now, while some of your Pokémon in the game can evolve with the utmost ease, others require a bit more of a special touch, and that special touch comes in the form of evolution items. Necessary for certain species of Pokémon, evolution items can be somewhat elusive – one of the rarer ones being the Sun Stone.</p><p><strong>Pokémon Go Sun Stone evolutions</strong> can improve your entire in-game experience, so learn all about them below.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Sun-Stones-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Sun-Stones-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

You’ll most commonly get species-specific candy used for evolutions whenever you catch a specific Pokémon. Depending on the species, you’ll need more or less candy to evolve them. (And don’t worry, evolutions don’t affect the total number of Pokémon in your collection).</p><p>Depending on the specific Pokémon you want to evolve, you might need additional items or even need to perform a particular task. Some Pokémon will need to be walked as your Buddy Pokémon before they can evolve. Others can be evolved through trading them. Others can only evolve with the help of evolution items like the Sun Stone.</p><p>Pokémon Sun Stone evolutions will require you to collect the Sun Stone and a certain amount of candy (which can vary by Pokémon).</p><p>You can always check out how to evolve your Pokémon in your Pokédex.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Which-Pokemon-Evolve-With-Sun-Stones"><a href="#Part-3-Which-Pokemon-Evolve-With-Sun-Stones" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

You can get excellent XP bonuses, come across special Pokémon, enjoy more candy and stardust, encounter special raid bosses, and so much more. Of course, you can also increase your chances of encountering rare evolution items like the Sun Stone.</p><p>Pokémon Go will frequently have multiple special events happening every month. Some of the events happening in February 2024 include:</p><ul><li>Lunar New Year – February 5 to February 11;</li><li>Carnival of Love – February 13 to February 15;</li><li>Road to Sinnoh – February 19 to February 23.</li></ul><p>You’ll be notified of any ongoing special events as soon as you start your game, so check your phone at least once daily. While partaking in a special event doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a Sun Stone, there’s always a possibility!</p><h3 id="Field-Research"><a href="#Field-Research" class="headerlink" title="Field Research"></a>Field Research</h3><p>Throughout your game, Professor Willow will need your help to learn more about Pokémon, so he’ll send you on different research tasks. Of course, you’ll always be generously rewarded for your efforts.</p><p>Among the different types of research the professor sends you is field research. You can collect your field research tasks by spinning the Photo Disc at a PokéStop. You can only collect and work on three field research tasks simultaneously, though a fourth one will open if you receive bonus research. Moreover, you and your friends can work together to complete the same field research if you all go to the same PokéStop on the same day.</p><p>As you’re completing your field research tasks, you can collect your rewards, earn stamps, and unlock breakthroughs. Hopefully, one of the rewards you receive will include the Sun Stone, allowing you to evolve some of your Pokémon.</p><h3 id="Special-Research"><a href="#Special-Research" class="headerlink" title="Special Research"></a>Special Research</h3><p>With field research, you have some flexibility. You can visit PokéStops when you’re up for them, and you can even discard some tasks if they’re too difficult for you. With special research, you don’t have all that much flexibility.</p><p>Professor Willow will contact you directly and give you specific tasks you must complete. You can’t disregard or discard them.</p><p>As a rule, special research will be more involved and will likely last longer than field research. However, your rewards will usually be much more valuable, and you’ll exponentially increase your chances of obtaining a Sun Stone.</p><h3 id="Gyms-and-PokeStops"><a href="#Gyms-and-PokeStops" class="headerlink" title="Gyms and PokeStops"></a>Gyms and PokeStops</h3><p>Of course, you can always earn valuable rewards by simply visiting gyms and PokéStops and spinning the Photo Discs. Create a 7-day PokéStop streak, as that will guarantee you’ll get an evolution item.</p><p>While you’ll usually get a more common evolution item after your 7-day streak, you might get a Sun Stone or something even more valuable.</p><p>Usually, it’s in your best interest to go to more popular areas with more PokéStops, as you’ll be able to make more spins faster.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Gather-Sun-Stones-Efficiently"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Gather-Sun-Stones-Efficiently" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

After all, Pokémon Go is a location-based game that requires you to go out into town and wander the streets of your city. There’s virtually no task you can complete from the comfort of your home unless you have an ace up your sleeve.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone virtual location can be a game-changer for completing your field research tasks quickly. A tool designed to spoof your location and make it seem like you’re out and about while you’re actually just relaxing at home, it can help you finish your field research without much fuss.</p><p>You can use the Dr. Fone virtual location to set your location to anywhere in the world. Create a one-stop or multi-stop route to make the game believe you’re moving around, or even use the jump-teleport mode to “transfer” to a more resource-rich location. However, be careful with the jump-teleport mode, as it can betray the fact that you’re using a location spoofer.</p><p>To get started with Wondershare Dr.Fone and complete your field research tasks, you must follow a few steps:</p><ol><li>Download and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer;</li><li>Connect your phone to your computer;</li><li>Go to <strong>Toolbox &gt; Virtual Location &gt; Get Started</strong>;</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="get started with wondershare dr.fone"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>On the map that shows up, click on <strong>No Device</strong>in the upper right-hand corner;</li><li>You’ll see a list of all connected devices, select your phone;</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-1.png"                      alt="choose the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device you want to connect to dr.fone"                ></p><ol start="6"><li>On your phone, tap <strong>Allow USB Debugging</strong>;</li><li>On your phone, go to <strong>Developer Options&gt; Select mock location app</strong>;</li><li>Select <strong>Fone</strong>.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-3.png"                      alt="set up mock location on your phone"                ></p><p>From there, you can easily set up your route, change your location, and simulate movement. With Wondershare Dr.Fone, you’ll have intuitive keyboard controls, 360-degree directions, and automated movement. So, as soon as you set things up in the app, you can start playing the game, completing your field research tasks, and, hopefully, acquiring your Sun Stones.</p><h3 id="Pay-Attention-to-Community-Days-and-Special-Events"><a href="#Pay-Attention-to-Community-Days-and-Special-Events" class="headerlink" title="Pay Attention to Community Days and Special Events"></a>Pay Attention to Community Days and Special Events</h3><p>Finally, to start getting Sun Stones and other rarer items more efficiently, you’ll always want to pay close attention to community days and special events. Pokémon Go is a very active game with frequent high-rewarding events that could happen at any time. Since these events are time-limited, you’ll always want to know precisely when they start and end.</p><p>Fortunately, finding this out is pretty easy. Just keep track of Pokémon Go on social media or visit the official Pokémon Go website to find out more. All events will be announced ahead of time so that you can prepare.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Acquiring Sun Stones for Pokémon evolutions can be quite a hassle. This rare evolution item can be a tricky find.
