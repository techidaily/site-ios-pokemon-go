Players get to be a part of the various regions of the Pokemon has now become one with our world. The game requires you to travel to different locations to complete researches, catch Pokemon, defend gyms, and most importantly, complete the Pokedex given by Professor Willow. Niantic’s games are designed to be played with others outdoors. This feature ends up giving players in some parts of the world advantage over others. This is specially to catch regional Pokemon and during ticketed events and sponsored events. Spoofers can avoid the barriers of distance and play anywhere in the world by iSpoofer for pogo installation and other such apps. Niantic, however, does not allow this and considers it the same as hacking. Players who were looking to play and access all the features of the game available all across the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Will-the-iSpoofer-back-on-2020"><a href="#Part-1-Will-the-iSpoofer-back-on-2020" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Will the iSpoofer back on 2020?"></a>Part 1: Will the iSpoofer back on 2020?</h2><p>iSpoofer has been shut down. All its applications, websites, and other related services have been terminated. iSpoofer for pogo installation does not exist. If any website claims to give access to the application or iSpoofer direct download, it is fake. Also, the new Pokemon Go application version which is 0.195.0 has been updated to detect applications like iSpoofer, so on being detected, it may lead to a warning, or a permanent ban as well. And we don’t see the certainty to get it back soon.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Detailed-guide-of-iSpoofer-for-pogo-installation"><a href="#Part-2-Detailed-guide-of-iSpoofer-for-pogo-installation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Detailed guide of iSpoofer for pogo installation"></a>Part 2: Detailed guide of iSpoofer for pogo installation</h2><p>This detailed guide for iSpoofer installation is for those who still possess the older version of the app that works in an older iOS version.</p><p><strong>Step 1 –</strong> Install the setup for iSpoofer on your computer if you had got it using. This requires the latest version of iTunes, so make sure that you have it installed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/install-ispoofer-setup.jpg"                      alt="install ispoofer setup"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2 –</strong> Once the setup is done, connect your phone to the computer and unlock it. You will have to select the “TRUST” option for the software to do its work. On selecting this option, iSpoofer will download a developer file that will spoof the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/unlock-and-trust-software.jpg"                      alt="unlock and trust software"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3 –</strong> A map will load on your computer screen, which allows you to enter or point the location. Enter the location of your choice and click on “MOVE”. And that is it! Three simple steps and you have spoofed!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-your-phone-location.jpg"                      alt="change your phone location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-the-iSpoofer-when-you-play-pokemon"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-the-iSpoofer-when-you-play-pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to use the iSpoofer when you play pokemon"></a>Part 3: How to use the iSpoofer when you play pokemon</h2><p>Follow the tutorial above for ispoofer for pogo installation.

From here you can either use the joystick to move around or use a “.gpx” file to add a preset route for you to move around. That would look like this -</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/gpx-file-for-preset-route.jpg"                      alt="gpx file for preset route"                ></p><p>iSpoofer for pogo installation has the following disadvantages -</p><ul><li>The application cannot work without iTunes and is very dependent on it.</li><li>Niantic can easily detect spoofing through this app and may lead to a ban.</li><li>Movement simulations are hard and unnatural, making it more susceptible to a ban.</li><li>Configurations and settings require some technical knowledge in to troubleshoot any errors.</li><li>The app is prone to crashing a lot.

When you lob a Pokéball at a Pokémon, there are chances that it could escape.</p><p>What if there was a way in which you could catch a Pokémon creature every time, even Legendary Pokémon?</p><p>The Pokémon emerald master ball can do this with no effort on your part. Simply activate the ball and the Pokémon is captured. This makes the emerald Pokémon master ball a very important asset. In this article, you get to know all the Pokémon master ball cheat codes that you can use to get these valuable assets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/masterball-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="An image of a Pokémon Master Ball"                ></p><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Catch Pokémon like a Pro with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location!

It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.</p><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.</p><p>The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.</p><p>The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work"><a href="#Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?"></a>Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?</h2><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.</p><p>The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.</p><p><strong>958D8046<br>A7151D70<br>8BB602F7<br>8CEB681A.</strong></p><p>All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.</p><p>If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.</p><p>You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.</p><p>When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:<br><strong>82005274 0001</strong></p><p>You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”.

All you have to do is enter any sort of gibberish that you want into the description and then enter the code shown above. You will now be able to get an unlimited number of Pokémon Emerald Master balls which you can use to capture as many Pokémon characters as you wish.</p><p><strong>Step 6 –</strong> Proceed and enter a PokeMart and then buy Pokeballs. When you have entered the Pokémon Emerald Master Ball code, you are allowed to buy as many of these as you can fit in your bag.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Planning-to-Use-a-Pokemon-Go-Joystick-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max"><a href="#Planning-to-Use-a-Pokemon-Go-Joystick-on-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="Planning to Use a Pokemon Go Joystick on Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max?"></a>Planning to Use a Pokemon Go Joystick on Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max?</h2><p>Pokemon Go is probably one of the most popular location-based augmented reality games that encourage us to step out. Sadly, players can’t explore their surroundings or travel to play the game all the time. That’s why they often take the assistance of a Pokemon Go joystick. While Pokemon joysticks are extremely popular, they have some downfalls as well if you don’t pick the right tool. Therefore, in this post, I will list the risks and benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick hack to help you make up your mind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Joystick Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Pokemon-Go-Joystick-101-Things-to-Know"><a href="#Part-1-Pokemon-Go-Joystick-101-Things-to-Know" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Pokemon Go Joystick 101: Things to Know"></a><strong>Part 1: Pokemon Go Joystick 101: Things to Know</strong></h2><p>Before we get into the details, it is important to know the basics of this fake GPS Pokemon Go hack. Ideally, Pokemon Go joysticks are dedicated mobile or desktop applications that let us simulate the movement of our device. In most of the spoofing tools for Pokemon Go, the following features are offered.</p><ul><li>Users can directly spoof their location on Pokemon Go to anywhere they like in the world.</li><li>They can also simulate the movement of their device (and the trainer) using the inbuilt joystick.</li><li>The Pokemon Go Joystick APK can also let you set up a preferred speed for walking, jogging, or running.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Joystick"                ></p><p>Therefore, with the help of a Pokemon Go hack APK like this, players don’t have to leave their house to catch Pokemons. They can also participate in raids to hatch eggs from the comfort of their home.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Playing-Pokemon-Go-with-a-Joystick"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Playing-Pokemon-Go-with-a-Joystick" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?"></a><strong>Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?</strong></h2><p>There are several reasons why Pokemon Go joystick iOS&#x2F;Android hacks are so popular. After all, they give us the convenience to play our favorite game without breaking a sweat. Here are some of the major reasons why Pokemon Go joystick hacks are becoming so popular:</p><ul><li><p>Stay Safe Indoors</p><p>  Since we are in the middle of a global pandemic, it is not recommended to go out to explore Pokemons. Besides that, your neighborhood might not be safe or there could be unfavorable weather conditions outside. Therefore, you can consider using a Pokemon Go joystick to catch Pokemons without compromising your safety.</p></li><li><p>Move Beyond your Area</p><p>  If you are in a rural area, then chances are that there could be limited spawning locations for Pokemons. With a fake GPS Pokemon Go app, you can spoof your location to any major city.</p></li><li><p>Catch More Pokemons</p><p>  One of the major benefits of using a Pokemon Go spoofer APK is that we can easily catch tons of Pokemons without exploring any area. Just enter the exact spawning location of the Pokemon and catch it!</p></li><li><p>Level-up in the Game Easily</p><p>  From participating in raids to hatching eggs faster, there are so many other things that you can do with a Pokemon Go joystick.</p></li><li><p>Have a Better Gaming Experience</p><p>  Overall, a Pokemon Go spoofing iOS&#x2F;Android solution will provide tons of add-on features that would improve your gaming experience.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-What-are-the-Risks-of-Using-Pokemon-Go-Joysticks"><a href="#Part-3-What-are-the-Risks-of-Using-Pokemon-Go-Joysticks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?"></a><strong>Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?</strong></h2><p>While there are numerous benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick, its constant use can also backfire in the long run.</p><ul><li><p>Account Ban by Niantic</p><p>  Ideally, you should know that the use of any third-party service (like a fake GPS Pokemon Go hack) is against the terms and conditions of the game. At first, if Niantic will detect its use, then it will simply display a warning message. Though, after several warning messages, if your account is still flagged, then it can get permanently banned.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-3.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Account Ban"                ></p><p>  To avoid the banning of your Pokemon Go account, you can consider a “cooldown duration”. This simply suggests waiting for a specific duration before changing your location in the game.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-4.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Cooldown Duration"                ></p></li><li><p>Software Hack on Jailbroken Devices</p><p>  To use a Pokemon Go joystick iOS hack, you might have to jailbreak your device. This can even null the warranty of your device and would make it susceptible to security threats. You might already know that a jailbroken device can easily be corrupted by the spoofer or any other app.</p></li><li><p>The Pokemon Go Spoofing Company Might Shut Down</p><p>  Chances are that the Pokemon Go spoofing solution that you have purchased might go out of business. For instance, iSpoofer (an iOS fake GPS tool) is no longer functioning and its existing users can’t even reach out to its customer support after getting their account banned. That’s why it is highly recommended to only pick a reliable Pokemon Go joystick solution.</p></li></ul><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>As you can see, picking a reliable Pokemon Go joystick is the most important thing to play the game remotely. Therefore, I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as the application is extremely easy to use and will meet all your Pokemon Go location spoofing needs. The best part is that you don’t even need to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to spoof its location using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location.</p><ul><li>Users can instantly spoof their location on Pokemon Go to anywhere they like by entering the exact coordinates or its address.</li><li>It also has dedicated one-stop and multi-stop modes that would let you set up a route to simulate the movement of your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.</li><li>If you want, you can even enter the preferred speed for the simulated movement or the number of times to cover it.</li><li>The application will display a dedicated GPS joystick, letting you move realistically on the map.</li><li>There is also an option to mark certain routes as favorites or import&#x2F;export routes as GPX files.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-15.png"                      alt="virtual location"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I hope that after following this guide, you would be able to know more about the fake GPS Pokemon Go hacks. As you can see, I have included all kinds of benefits and limitations of using a Pokemon Go joystick in this guide. If you don’t want to get your account banned for using a Pokemon joystick, then consider going with a reliable option like</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Without the need for jailbreaking, it will let you enjoy a dedicated GPS joystick and simulate your device movement remotely.</p><h2 id="Why-is-iPogo-not-working-On-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Fixed"><a href="#Why-is-iPogo-not-working-On-Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-Max-Fixed" class="headerlink" title="Why is iPogo not working On Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max? Fixed"></a>Why is iPogo not working On Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max? Fixed</h2><p>The popular iPogo app is one of the best free apps you can use to spoof on your device while playing Pokémon Go. It is equipped with an abundance of features that allows players to get way ahead in the game by spotting spawns early, catching gym raids, discovering nests and quest events, and so on. If you spot a Pokémon which is way too far from your location, you can use iPogo to fake your virtual coordinates and trick Pokémon Go to think you are nearby that area. Sounds like an amazing app to use right? But, there is a downside to it too as users of the app have repeatedly reported of iPogo not working. The app seems to overload and malfunction after a few hours of repeated usage. This issue is preventing users from harnessing the full potential of their gaming experience.</p><h3 id="Why-Users-download-iPogo"><a href="#Why-Users-download-iPogo" class="headerlink" title="Why Users download iPogo?"></a>Why Users download iPogo?</h3><p>iPogo is a free to use Pokémon Go++ mod which can be downloaded as an APK file for your iOS devices. It features tools that can be used by players to play the game virtually anywhere in the world while also enhancing the gameplay experience. Few of these exclusive features have been mentioned in the list below;</p><ul><li>The Spin and Auto-cash feature can be used to capture Pokémon and throw a spinning ball without requiring a physical device.</li><li>With just one click you can manage your collection of stored items. It removes the cumbersome ordeal of the game to manually select and delete items when you can erase all un-required items with just one tap.</li><li>If you are on the hunt for special shiny Pokémon, you can do so without having to go through dozens of non-shiny one’s. On activating the Auto-Runaway feature on your iPogo, you can skip through the time consuming animations of all non-shiny Pokémon.</li><li>You can augment the game to let your avatar walk continuously at a desired pace. The speed of your avatar’s movement can be adjusted using iPogo.</li><li>If there are unnecessary elements crowding up your screen, you can hide them temporarily.</li><li>You keep track of Pokémon spawns, quests and raids using the feed on your iPogo.</li></ul><p>With all these amazing benefits at hand, it seems almost unfair to not be able to make the best of it if iPogo keeps crashing or stops working. Let’s look into the probable reasons why your iPogo is not working and explore methods to solve this dilemma.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-problem-that-iPogo-is-not-working"><a href="#Part-1-Common-problem-that-iPogo-is-not-working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working"></a>Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working</h2><p>Pokémon Go players have made several reports of how iPogo is not functioning normally on their devices. For instance, while using the Plus mod on Pokémon Go, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device screen goes completely black and unresponsive making the game inaccessible. Also, devices that run Pokémon Go with iPogo seems to be running slower than those which do not use any helper or spoofing support.</p><p>Even if your device is able to withstand the load of using iPogo, it may still be possible to face other app related performance issues like ipogo enhanced-throw not working, ipogo joystick not working and ipogo feeds not working either. All these symptoms sums up the fact that the iPogo app is faltering on your device.</p><p>Read on to understand the reasons why your device is unable to run the iPogo mod smoothly;</p><ul><li>One of the root causes which explains why iPogo is crashing could be because you are utilizing too much of your phone’s system resource capacity. This means you have too many tabs or other applications opened on your device that is making the resource distribution falter leading to an automatic shutdown.</li><li>Another plausible reason could be that your iPogo application has not been properly installed. It is widely agreed upon that iPogo is a difficult app to install as it involves going through complex steps making it easier for mistakes to be made, eventually leading to a complete breakdown of the software.</li><li>Since installing iPogo is a cumbersome process, players would often resort to using downloading hacks to get the job done faster. However, not all such hacks can be relied upon as they may end up jail breaking your device or make your version of the app even more unstable.</li></ul><h3 id="Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue"><a href="#Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue" class="headerlink" title="Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue"></a>Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue</h3><p>It is often said that short cuts can cut you short or in this case, hacked! Disrupting the framework of your device is not price you should pay for enjoying the game at its best. Although, there are other safer and more reliable solutions to making the iPogo app run better on your iOS device. Let’s take a brief peak at some of them.</p><ul><li><strong>Limiting the usage of System Resources:</strong> Let’s keep in mind that it is unwise to keep too much on your plate and rightfully so. In this case, the more applications you keep active on your shortcut bar, the lesser resources your CPU has left to allocate to the iPogo app. Therefore, close off all other unnecessary applications before launching iPogo as it is already a heavy enough application to run on its own.</li><li><strong>Too many Items opened:</strong> Keep a tight check on your list of inventory while playing Pokémon Go using iPogo. Remember to delete all un-required collected items as it may be taking up too much space and wasting precious system resources.</li><li><strong>Keep you Device Clean:</strong> Not essentially in the literal sense but yes, it is indeed important to clean up your device often. Use a cleaner app that deletes and clears all those extra cache files that becomes the primary reason of system lag on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Install the Official Version:</strong> It may be tempting for anyone to install the app using shortcut hacks, but that’s all they are – just hacks! Installing iPogo seem like the long way but it is the right way on all accounts. There are three methods you can use to integrate the official iPogo app, all of which has been made more simplified.</li></ul><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Use the three-step app installation method which is direct and free to use.</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If you are opting for a matrix installation, in which case you will need a PC installed with either Windows, LINUX or MacOS.</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> The Signulous method is a premium mod that gives the player access to additional features.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> All of these installation methods have specific varied requirements which must be checked appropriately.</p><h2 id="Part-2-A-better-alternative-for-iPogo-virtual-location"><a href="#Part-2-A-better-alternative-for-iPogo-virtual-location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location"></a>Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location</h2><p>If using the iPogo mod to enhance your gaming experience on Pokémon Go seem less appealing with all the added hassle then there is a better alternative for you to use. You can employ a much simpler and easier to install GPS mocking application like Wondershare’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It offers amazing user-friendly features like speed modulation, joystick control and map routing with none of the drawbacks that you had to previously overcome. It is a highly efficient virtual location tool that can be used to conveniently spoof your location without running the risk of detection on a GPS based game like Pokémon Go.</p><h3 id="Primary-Features-of-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Primary-Features-of-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Primary Features of Dr. Fone"></a>Primary Features of Dr. Fone</h3><ul><li>Adjust the speed of travel with three speed modes, like walking, cycling or even driving.</li><li>Manually move your GPS on the map freely using a virtual joystick in a 360 degree direction.</li><li>Simulate your avatar’s movements to travel on a determined route of your choice.</li></ul><h3 id="Step-by-Step-Tutorial"><a href="#Step-by-Step-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Step by Step Tutorial"></a>Step by Step Tutorial</h3><p>You can follow these easy steps to teleport to anywhere in the world with the help of drfone Virtual Location.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Run the Program</strong></p><p>Begin with downloading Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) on your PC.

This can cause a sudden loss of your money and progress in Pokemon Go.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Spoof-iPhone-Location-without-Jailbreak-Using-the-Best-iPogo-Alternative"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Spoof-iPhone-Location-without-Jailbreak-Using-the-Best-iPogo-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Spoof iPhone Location without Jailbreak Using the Best iPogo Alternative?"></a>Part 4: How to Spoof iPhone Location without Jailbreak Using the Best iPogo Alternative?</h2><p>Since iPogo needs jailbreak access and is not that reliable, a lot of players look for its alternative. For instance, you can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to easily spoof the location on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro without jailbreaking it. The application is super easy to use and also provides a GPS joystick to stimulate your movement between multiple spots. Besides that, you can also mark any location as a favorite and can even import&#x2F;export GPX files using the desktop application.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro and launch Dr.Fone – Virtual Location</strong></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Simply connect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro to the computer and launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location application. You can now agree to its terms and conditions and select the connected device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="iPogo Location Spoofing"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Spoof your Apple iPhone 12 Pro location to anywhere you like</strong></p><p>The application will automatically detect and display the present location of your device. You can now click on the Teleport Mode feature from the top to spoof your Apple iPhone 12 Pro’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="virtual-location"                ></p><p>Afterward, you can just enter the name, address, or coordinates of the target location on the search bar and load it on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p>You can now adjust the location on the map by moving the pin around or even zoom in&#x2F;out. Lastly, click on the “Move Here” button and wait as your device’s location would be updated on Pokemon Go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="virtual location 05"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Simulate your Apple iPhone 12 Pro’s movement between multiple spots</strong></p><p>Apart from that, you can also simulate the movement of your device by selecting the One-stop or Multi-stop modes from the top. This will let you drop the pins on the map to create a route for Pokemon Go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="virtual location 06"                ></p><p>Furthermore, you can enter the number of times to cover the route and even select a preferred speed for the movement.

And such is the use of <strong>Pokemon Go promo codes</strong> and Pokemon promo cards. Pokemon Go promo codes are short-time alphanumeric codes that allow you to receive free in-game items, as Pokemon prize cards are awards that are gifted to the players who can intensely beat the Pokemon and knock it out.</p><p>Pokemon promo codes or promo cards elevate your game to a whole new level since you will be able to possess the Poke balls, berries, lucky eggs, incense, and other various loots. They will make your game an absolute breeze, and you necessarily won’t move around as you play. Besides, Pokemon promo codes are short-lasting; you, therefore, need to claim them quickly.</p><p>This article gives an insight on how to get and use Pokemon Go promo codes and promo cards.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Get-Pokemon-Go-Promo-Codes"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Get-Pokemon-Go-Promo-Codes" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Get Pokemon Go Promo Codes"></a>Part 1: How to Get Pokemon Go Promo Codes</h2><p>Pokemon Go often offers promo codes on special events or after successful partnerships.</p><p>The availability of Pokemon promo codes is not constant – They do come and go.</p><p>Pokemon promo codes are unpredictable, and so are their rewards.

The Android and iOS mobile phones all have different ways of redeeming the promo codes. Android device is through the app itself, while the iOS device is through the Pokemon Go Niantic official website.</p><p> <strong>Android devices –</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/07/pokemon-go-promo-codes.jpg"                      alt="redeem pokemon go promo codes on Android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1.

However, this should not limit your play. You don’t necessarily have to move around for you to catch the Pokemon. You can still enjoy playing Pokemon Go in your comfort.

Tap the build number about five times until a pop-up notification <strong>‘You are now a developer’</strong> appears.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Download the Fake GPS Location app to your Android device</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokekom-go-teleport-safely-13.jpg"                      alt="download the fake gps location on your Android"                ></p><p>Go to the Google Play Store and download Fake GPS Location to your Android phone.

The game attains new spheres and seems more interesting with a location spoofer involved. If you are an iOS user or an Android enthusiast who is eager for iSpoofer’s return or worried about iSpoofer Pogo not working, then this might just be the right article for you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-am-I-unable-to-download-iSpoofer-for-Pogo"><a href="#Part-1-Why-am-I-unable-to-download-iSpoofer-for-Pogo" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?"></a>Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?</h2><p>iSpoofer was discontinued two years ago, around 2019 and still remains out of action. This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application.

Catching little cuddles and fighting to catch more-powerful Pokémon is really fun. In addition to fun, this game also increases your knowledge about the surrounding area and the diversity around your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-1.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>For example, if you want to catch the special characters or characters of another city, you have to that place. This is the only drawback for players. However, with location spoofing apps, you can catch characters from any location without actually moving there.</p><p>But, spoofing Pokémon Go is not easy, as Niantic keeps a close watch to spoofers. To spoof the Pogo, you will need trusted and safe spoofing apps like PGSharp for android and Dr.Fone virtual location for iOS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-2.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Let’s find out how PGSharp and Dr.Fone virtual location app save you from getting banned while spoofing Pokémon Go.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Ninatic-Policies-against-Spoofing"><a href="#Part-1-Ninatic-Policies-against-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Ninatic Policies against Spoofing"></a>Part 1: Ninatic Policies against Spoofing</h2><p>Getting banned for cheating Pokémon is nothing new. Niantic always modifies the policies to catch the spoofers and to maintain the originality of the game. Niantic has made a proper discipline policy with three strikes to punish the spoofers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-3.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Firstly, punishment:</strong> On the first fake strike, you will get a warning message, but you still can play the game. But, while plying, you will not be able to anything remotely for about seven days.</p><p><strong>Secondly, Punishment:</strong> On the second fake strike, Niantic may close your account temporarily for a month. It also gives you a warning message for future misuse of the game.</p><p><strong>Thirdly, Punishment:</strong> On the third strike, Niantic will ban the account for more than a month.</p><p>However, if you get caught regularly, the developer of Pokémon Go has the authority to permanently ban your account.</p><h3 id="Does-it-mean-you-can-never-spoof-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Does-it-mean-you-can-never-spoof-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Does it mean you can never spoof Pokémon Go?"></a>Does it mean you can never spoof Pokémon Go?</h3><p>No, you can spoof Pokémon Go with the best spoofing tools like PGSHarp and Dr.Fone virtual location.</p><p><strong>Why PGSharp?</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-4.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>This tool is safe and secure to use, plus it offers a real map interface, and it is difficult for Niantic to catch it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Avoid-Being-Banned-From-Spoofing"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Avoid-Being-Banned-From-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Avoid Being Banned From Spoofing"></a>Part 2: How to Avoid Being Banned From Spoofing</h2><p>There are tricks that help you save from the Pokémon Go ban.</p><ul><li>First, you need to use a reliable tool like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone for iOS to spoof the GPS. By doing so, Niantic can’t catch you.</li><li>Never use a modified game or third-party client to catch Pokémon. You never know the client may be a worker in the developer’s office. Therefore, you will get caught easily.</li><li>You need to be very careful about your movement in the game. If you are using a fake GPS app, then make sure your movements are reasonable. It means do not switch long-distance locations in few hours or frequently. It is because this makes it unreal in Niantic radar and may cause you a problem.</li><li>Finally, do not root your Phone, be it Android or iPhone. It is because when you root your device, its security gets compromised, and it is easy to get data about your device’s fake location. And, your Pokémon Go account also can be at risk.</li></ul><p>Therefore, in order to catch special and maximum Pokémon, you do not need to cheat the game, only PGSharp is enough. With this, you can play the game just by sitting at your home. All you need to do is install PGSharp on your device and launch it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-makes-PGSharp-best-app-to-spoof-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-3-What-makes-PGSharp-best-app-to-spoof-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What makes PGSharp best app to spoof Pokémon Go"></a>Part 3: What makes PGSharp best app to spoof Pokémon Go</h2><p>The features and functions of PGSharp make it a safe spoofing app for Pokémon Go.

But sometimes iPogo can’t install, and users face a lot of difficulties. At that moment, some users feel furious and look forward to the solutions to get rid of it. If you also hit in the same category, you are on the right page. Let’s discuss it more and look forward to the solution that will help you to install it again.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-that-you-can’t-install-the-ipogo"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-that-you-can’t-install-the-ipogo" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons that you can’t install the ipogo"></a>Part 1: Reasons that you can’t install the ipogo</h2><p>There are multiple reasons that contribute to the difficulty when you can’t install the iPogo. Some of them are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>iPhone version:</strong></li></ul><p>The current iPhone version you are choosing may be responsible for the problem for iPogo can’t install. It is important to have iOS version 13. It works on all the known jailbreak devices having the same iOS. In case you have upgraded the iOS 13 to iOS 14, the chances are quite less to use it.</p><ul><li><strong>iPogo version:</strong></li></ul><p>iPogo version is also an important factor of consideration. Time to time regular updates keep coming, and if you are stuck on the previous version, you will not be able to use it. Sometimes the iPogo is down whenever there is an update, and when you try to update it, the problem arises. At that moment, you need to be patient and try re-installation.</p><ul><li><strong>Direct download method:</strong></li></ul><p>If a user is considering direct downloading method, they might also face this trouble because Apple now targets certificate. Now you need to create your certificate with the help of a computer or a paid service like Signulous and others.</p><h3 id="Bonus-Simple-steps-to-install-iPogo"><a href="#Bonus-Simple-steps-to-install-iPogo" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: Simple steps to install iPogo"></a>Bonus: Simple steps to install iPogo</h3><p>To install iPogo, we suggest you avoid the direct download method and instead follow the steps to follow with “Matrix installer.”</p><p><strong>Steps to follow:</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Upgrade the iTunes version of your computer to latest version.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now remove the original app from your iDevice.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Get IPA from the website download and save it.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Launch the “Matrix Installer”.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> With the help of USB cable connect your Apple iPhone 13 to the PC.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Let the installer to detect the iDevice.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Now click on “Device” then “Install Package” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/ipogo-install-package.jpg"                      alt="ipogo install package"                ></p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Now the installer asks for the Apple ID username, and Password mentions the same. Make sure these are the ones used to fetch the developer certificate from the Apple Server. (We suggest you create a new Apple ID)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/ipogo-install-enter-apple-id.jpg"                      alt="ipogo install enter apple id"                ></p><p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Be patient for a while and let the impact or to perform all the work.</p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> “Complete” message will appear and unlock your Apple iPhone 13 Screen and move to “settings-&gt;General-&gt; device management.”</p><p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Now hit on the developer Apple ID and trust it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/ipogo-installing-click-trust.jpg"                      alt="ipogo installing click trust"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Risk-of-installing-ipogo-and-running"><a href="#Part-2-Risk-of-installing-ipogo-and-running" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Risk of installing ipogo and running"></a>Part 2: Risk of installing ipogo and running</h2><p>You can come across a certain risks also when you are installing and running iPogo. These are as follows:</p><p><strong>Jailbreaking is required:</strong></p><p>For using iPogo, jailbreaking is required, and it refers to the privilege to Apple devices through which they can remove all the software restrictions. If there is any loss to the data, a user will be responsible for it.</p><p><strong>Chances to get banned:</strong></p><p>iPogo is an application that can be used after jailbreaking only. After doing the jailbreaking, the chances are there that your device might get banned.

The mock location of Dr.Fone lets you simulate your position and permits your mobile application to presume that you have selected the application interface of Dr.Fone without any restrain or recognition from developers of Pokémon Go. Follow the instructions below to catch Pokémon any place without making any movement.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install:</strong></p><p>Install the ‘Dr. Fone toolkit’ from the official website after downloading it.

Next, click the leftmost button on the top-right corner of the window to start the ‘Teleport’ mode. Then search the places you wish to mock your position with, and press ‘Go’ after the selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="virtual location 8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Imitate Movement between steps:</strong></p><p>To start the simulation, make a movement and traverse to the ‘Move Here’ button to reach multiple times.

The component is called after the multi-stop path that can be chosen from the GUI toolbox class positioned at the top-right nook that lets you put numerous specified destinations on the map, and your position will behave appropriately as controlled by the virtual location application of Dr.Fone.</p><p>To grant permission to the system to mock movement by picking out the right options, press the ‘March’ button.

It is original since each and every other Pokémon has been announced in either the main games or using the Pokémon animation. Meltan has very restricted accessibility and Meltan evolution, Melmetal can yet solely be evolved in Pokémon Go. Until now, there were only two ways of catching Meltan - transferring a Pokémon from Pokémon Go to Pokémon Home or associating your Pokémon Go account to Let’s Go, Pikachu! or Let’s Go, Eevee! Now there is another way of capturing Meltan, that is, by opening a mystery box. You can get a Mystery Box that opens once a week by connecting your ‘Pokémon Go’ and ‘Pokémon Home’ accounts as described earlier.</p><p>The Mystery Box will act as an essence precisely for Meltan, attracting a large amount of the small Hex Nut Pokémon to your locality for one hour. It takes time to recharge, about three days, but after it is charged, you have to transfer another Pokémon to HOME to be able to use it again for an hour. If you get to use the Mystery Box in the course of specific events, you can even grab a Shiny Meltan.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-home-vs-pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="pokemon home vs pokemon go"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Pokémon is one of the most enjoyable games, not only because it yields prizes such as the mystery box Pokémon, Meltan Pokémon, shiny Meltan Pokémon go, but it also develops players’ interest completely.

Like all other games, the publisher always tries their best to make the user experience more enriching and fair for the users.</p><p>Season 1 of the Battle League’s had a severe bug that a handful of players exploited to rise to the leader board. After a player has lodged few fast moves, (number of fast moves required for each Pokémon to charge attack, varies) the trainer’s Pokémon can lodge a secondary yet stronger charged attack to deal more damage.</p><p>The bug in the series implied that a Pokémon – “Melmetal” is able to recharge their charge attack even while attacking with a “Charged” move, essentially making the trainer using the Pokémon invincible during a real battle.</p><p>Several trainers immediately tweeted this excruciating bug to Niantic requesting this issue to be resolved immediately, as a result Niantic had to freeze the leader board for that season.</p><p>Players when entering the Battle League are shown – Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available Right Now, and all matches that were in progress were not concluded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-1.jpg"                      alt="pokemon 1"                ></p><p>Thankfully, the issue has been resolved and trainers can get back into the league without any change in the previous features.</p><p>Here’s a set of few known issues in the game currently being investigated by Niantic, which we can hope to see resolved later on in the future;</p><ul><li><strong>Inconsistent Fast Attacks against Opponent Charged Attacks –</strong> Your fast attacks don’t land a direct hit when the opponent is throwing his Charged Attack.</li><li><strong>Fast Attacks are slower on Android –</strong> Most android users are experiencing slower fast attacks than iOS users.

What is the Pokemon Go PvP Rank Game?"></a>Part 1. What is the Pokemon Go PvP Rank Game?</h2><p>When talking about Pokemon Go, the first thing that usually comes to mind is Pokemon hunting and spinning PokeStops. Well, it’s true to a certain degree. Your main goal as a trainer is to build large Pokemon collections and obtain as many rewards as you can. However, there’s actually more to it. Players are also given the option to increase their ranking by battling another trainer. Yes. That is called the Pokemon Go PvP rank game.</p><p>Pokemon Go PvP rank battles are far different from other forms of duel in the game. Why so? The simplest explanation is that your opponent in PvP is a real human trainer, not a pre-mediated computer program. That’s why you may expect that winning on this battlefield is not going to be a smooth ride. You have to gear up your gaming skills very well and prepare a competent strategy to bring home victory. Don’t worry. It’s just a matter of timing and practice. Just go to a match regularly and learn from every experience. That’s the ultimate secret to ace Pokemon Go PvP rank battles.</p><p>There are lots of sensible reasons why you should engage in the Pokemon Go PvP rank game. Some of them are enumerated below.

Therefore, playing Pokemon Go PvP rank battles for a change of scenery is great. It somehow gives us a perfect dose of distraction at times when we feel bored and unmotivated.</p><h3 id="It-allows-players-to-learn-new-gaming-skills-and-improve-their-techniques"><a href="#It-allows-players-to-learn-new-gaming-skills-and-improve-their-techniques" class="headerlink" title="It allows players to learn new gaming skills and improve their techniques"></a>It allows players to learn new gaming skills and improve their techniques</h3><p>Sure. Catching Pokemon in the wild and visiting nearby PokeStops are incredibly fun activities. However, these tasks are not enough to give players a very constructive gaming training.

You can take it slowly and try to work your way up one step at a time.</p><h3 id="It-serves-as-your-key-to-special-tournaments-and-worldwide-events"><a href="#It-serves-as-your-key-to-special-tournaments-and-worldwide-events" class="headerlink" title="It serves as your key to special tournaments and worldwide events"></a>It serves as your key to special tournaments and worldwide events</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/pokemon-go-pvp-rank-2.JPG"                      alt="pokemon go battles"                ></p><p>Pokemon Go is holding various tournaments from time to time. However, some of these events require players to garner a specific rank or rating in Pokemon Go PvP battles. That means you cannot join if you don’t meet a particular rank level required in the game. Therefore, strive harder to participate in PvP games and win as many duels as you can. Your Pokemon PvP ranking is not just a mere group of numbers. It actually defines your eligibility to join prestigious Pokemon Go events.

However, you don’t necessarily have to remember the location of each regional Pokemon, as there are other ways of learning about their distribution.</p><h3 id="Getting-Information-From-the-Community"><a href="#Getting-Information-From-the-Community" class="headerlink" title="Getting Information From the Community"></a>Getting Information From the Community</h3><p>The primary method of acquiring information that most players rely on is keeping in touch with the Pokemon GO community. Players can follow Pokemon GO creators, watch YouTube news channels covering new releases, and join countless forums and social media pages dedicated to the game.</p><h3 id="Using-Official-Pokemon-Go-Announcements"><a href="#Using-Official-Pokemon-Go-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Using Official Pokemon Go Announcements"></a>Using Official Pokemon Go Announcements</h3><p>Official announcements are another way to learn more about Pokemon GO’s regional exclusives. Keeping track of these will help you track regional spawn points and special events. Enabling notifications from the game on your mobile device can also be particularly helpful in keeping track of announcements.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Quickly-Travel-to-Different-Regions"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Quickly-Travel-to-Different-Regions" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. How to Quickly Travel to Different Regions"></a>Part 5. How to Quickly Travel to Different Regions</h2><p>While regional Pokemon GO exclusives have brought novelties to Niantic’s viral AR game, they require a lot of traveling and trading, making it significantly more challenging for players to catch them all, which is the whole point of the game.</p><p>However, there’s also an alternative to traveling and trading, as countless virtual location-changing apps can help avid Pokemon GO players catch these exclusive beasts. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a fantastic example of such a tool, and with a quick setup and a few clicks, it can help players move without moving.</p><p>Using Dr.Fone to change your virtual location is remarkably straightforward and can be done in a few steps. Here’s how:</p><ol><li><p>Download the app from <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>the official website</u></a>and install it on your computer.</p></li><li><p>Click <strong>Toolbox</strong>in the upper left part of the screen and select <strong>Virtual Location</strong>.</p></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="wondershare dr.fone’s home page"                ></p><ol start="5"><li>Connect your Apple iPhone SE (2020) or Android to the computer via USB or Wi-Fi.</li><li>Select the <strong>Teleport Mode</strong>in the top right part.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="use dr.fone’s teleport mode feature"                ></p><ol start="8"><li>Type in a location and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="select a new virtual location"                ></p><ol start="10"><li>Change your virtual location by clicking the <strong>Move Here</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move to the selected virtual location"                ></p><ol start="12"><li>The app’s location will now change on PC.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-06.png"                      alt="verify location change on the computer"                ></p><ol start="14"><li>You should also check your mobile device’s location to confirm it’s changed.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="confirm location change on the phone"                ></p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone also includes a Jump Teleport Mode, allowing you to swiftly swap virtual locations and simulate movement along a predestined route.

Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events"></a>Part 6. Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events</h2><p>While incredibly straightforward and helpful, changing your virtual location isn’t the only way you can go about catching Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures.</p><p>The game’s special events often remove regional Pokemon distribution restrictions, allowing exclusive creatures to spawn around the globe for a particular period. With these, you can find and catch Asia-specific Pokemon in North America and vice versa.</p><p>It’s worth noting that these special events are pretty rare in Pokemon GO. You’ll need to pay close attention to the game’s announcements, as you don’t want to miss an opportunity to add another, hard-to-find, regional Pokemon to your Pokedex.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Trading-Regional-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-7-Trading-Regional-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon"></a>Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon</h2><p>As mentioned above, trading regional Pokemon GO exclusives is another one of your options if you can’t or don’t want to travel. Players can find other users from around the globe and initiate Pokemon GO creature exchanges to complete their Pokedex with all the available regionals.</p><p>However, trading regional Pokemon can also be quite challenging as it requires finding users willing to swap their region-specific Pokemon for the ones you have. There’ll undoubtedly be situations where users might not want to give up a more valuable catch for the one in your region, making trading a less viable option than changing your virtual location.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Completing your Pokedex and becoming the ultimate Pokemon trainer in Niantic’s viral AR game can be particularly challenging due to Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures. To catch these, players must travel to regions where these Pokemon spawn, trade with other users who’ve visited these areas, or wait for the game’s special events to lift regional spawn restrictions.</p><p>Alternatively, Pokemon trainers can use GPS-spoofing apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone and its Virtual Location Changer feature to change their mobile device’s GPS location. This helpful feature lets players move without moving and travel to specific regional spawn points without physically going there.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-use-pokemon-go-joystick-on-apple-iphone-6s-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to use Pokemon Go Joystick on Apple iPhone 6s Plus?

Some players could simply use “charged moves” repetitively without recharging. Thankfully Niantic is coming up with a fix.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-the-Go-battle-league-known-issues"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-the-Go-battle-league-known-issues" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are the Go battle league known issues?"></a>Part 1: What are the Go battle league known issues?</h2><p>Pokémon Go as a game, is constantly evolving to improve the trainer’s experience which involves finding issues and resolving them. Like all other games, the publisher always tries their best to make the user experience more enriching and fair for the users.</p><p>Season 1 of the Battle League’s had a severe bug that a handful of players exploited to rise to the leader board. After a player has lodged few fast moves, (number of fast moves required for each Pokémon to charge attack, varies) the trainer’s Pokémon can lodge a secondary yet stronger charged attack to deal more damage.</p><p>The bug in the series implied that a Pokémon – “Melmetal” is able to recharge their charge attack even while attacking with a “Charged” move, essentially making the trainer using the Pokémon invincible during a real battle.</p><p>Several trainers immediately tweeted this excruciating bug to Niantic requesting this issue to be resolved immediately, as a result Niantic had to freeze the leader board for that season.</p><p>Players when entering the Battle League are shown – Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available Right Now, and all matches that were in progress were not concluded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-1.jpg"                      alt="pokemon 1"                ></p><p>Thankfully, the issue has been resolved and trainers can get back into the league without any change in the previous features.</p><p>Here’s a set of few known issues in the game currently being investigated by Niantic, which we can hope to see resolved later on in the future;</p><ul><li><strong>Inconsistent Fast Attacks against Opponent Charged Attacks –</strong> Your fast attacks don’t land a direct hit when the opponent is throwing his Charged Attack.</li><li><strong>Fast Attacks are slower on Android –</strong> Most android users are experiencing slower fast attacks than iOS users. Niantic has addressed the issue and are awaiting more reports on the issue.</li><li><strong>Charged Attack Button doesn’t work when tapped -</strong> Occasionally after few uses, the Charged Attack button fails to respond when tapped resulting in slower attacks during matches.</li><li><strong>Go Battle wins are not counted –</strong> Some times, a Go battle win is not counted in the Go Battle League Set and remains unrecorded in the journal.</li><li><strong>Animation Glitch of the trainer throwing a Poke ball –</strong> A glitch occurs occasionally when the trainer avatar is seen throwing a Poke Ball repetitively.</li><li><strong>Disappearance of the Charged Attack and Switch Button –</strong> The button of the Charge Attack and the Switch Pokémon button would eventually disappear in-enabling the trainer to take any action during live battle.</li><li><strong>Next Battle tab not showing up on the Post-win Screen –</strong> After ending a match or winning a battle, the button for the ‘Next Battle’ option disappears from the Post-win screen.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Why-does-the-go-battle-not-available"><a href="#Part-2-Why-does-the-go-battle-not-available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why does the go battle not available?"></a>Part 2: Why does the go battle not available?</h2><p>It’s not new for an augmented reality game to have bugs that impede on the fun aspect of the game, but the recent development to Pokémon Go included an update trainers have been waiting for since its release in 2016.</p><p>Battle League is a brand new additional feature to the game that allows players to play PVP or one on one matches with other trainers. Ninantic introduced Battle tournaments to be played in three leagues – Great, Ultra and Master, that gives trainers the opportunity to compete and gain dominance over score board.</p><p>Pokémon Go is now exploring its roots with Pvp being a part of the original game franchise. We can hope to see the game evolve into a platform for global players to go head to head with each other.</p><p>The first season of Pokémon Go Battle League had to be temporarily frozen due to prevalence of broken code (a.k.a. – bug) that created a loophole allowing certain players and unfair advantage.</p><p>After attacking your opponent with a Charge move, the move set requires a brief time to recharge in order for the player to be able to use it again.</p><p>Few players with the assist of Melmetal (ground and steel type) could lodge constant fast attacks while also using Charge moves with no recharge time. This landed a handful these players to skyrocket to the leader board.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon 2"                ></p><p>After this issue was tweeted to the notice of the game publisher, Ninattic temporarily paused Battle League. Trainers while accessing the live tournament event would be notified with – “Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available” by the game.</p><p>Although this doesn’t mean that trainers wouldn’t be able to play practice matches or close proximity matches. Battle League presents itself as an event in the game which gives trainers the chance to earn bonuses and stardust.</p><p>Even so, Pokémon Go continues to resolve issues as they come along and this shows us how there is so much more to look forward to. Battle Leagues, since its debut has had 4 seasons till now and trainers are all pumped for Season 5.</p><p>Here’s a list of exciting updates that will be included in the upcoming season;</p><ul><li>At Rank 7 you will encounter a Legendary Pokémon on the Go Battle League battle tracks as similar to the Legendary Pokémon encountered in 5star raids.</li><li>To reach Rank 2 a trainer will need to complete a number of Battles in order to progress.</li><li>From Rank 3 all the way to Rank 10, a higher number of battles must be won to proceed.</li><li>Season 5 will be completed once you reach rank 7 which will earn you the Elite Charged TM rather than an Elite Fast TM.</li><li>In Season 5 few Pokémon’s will get new updated move sets which the trainers can use to train and prepare for upcoming tournaments.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-you-want-to-level-up-your-pokemon-go"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-you-want-to-level-up-your-pokemon-go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Tips you want to level up your pokemon go?"></a>Part 3: Tips you want to level up your pokemon go?</h2><p>The basics you need to learn to play Pokémon go is catching Pokémon and powering them up.

Catching little cuddles and fighting to catch more-powerful Pokémon is really fun. In addition to fun, this game also increases your knowledge about the surrounding area and the diversity around your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-1.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>For example, if you want to catch the special characters or characters of another city, you have to that place. This is the only drawback for players. However, with location spoofing apps, you can catch characters from any location without actually moving there.</p><p>But, spoofing Pokémon Go is not easy, as Niantic keeps a close watch to spoofers. To spoof the Pogo, you will need trusted and safe spoofing apps like PGSharp for android and Dr.Fone virtual location for iOS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-2.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Let’s find out how PGSharp and Dr.Fone virtual location app save you from getting banned while spoofing Pokémon Go.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Ninatic-Policies-against-Spoofing"><a href="#Part-1-Ninatic-Policies-against-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Ninatic Policies against Spoofing"></a>Part 1: Ninatic Policies against Spoofing</h2><p>Getting banned for cheating Pokémon is nothing new. Niantic always modifies the policies to catch the spoofers and to maintain the originality of the game. Niantic has made a proper discipline policy with three strikes to punish the spoofers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-3.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Firstly, punishment:</strong> On the first fake strike, you will get a warning message, but you still can play the game. But, while plying, you will not be able to anything remotely for about seven days.</p><p><strong>Secondly, Punishment:</strong> On the second fake strike, Niantic may close your account temporarily for a month. It also gives you a warning message for future misuse of the game.</p><p><strong>Thirdly, Punishment:</strong> On the third strike, Niantic will ban the account for more than a month.</p><p>However, if you get caught regularly, the developer of Pokémon Go has the authority to permanently ban your account.</p><h3 id="Does-it-mean-you-can-never-spoof-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Does-it-mean-you-can-never-spoof-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Does it mean you can never spoof Pokémon Go?"></a>Does it mean you can never spoof Pokémon Go?</h3><p>No, you can spoof Pokémon Go with the best spoofing tools like PGSHarp and Dr.Fone virtual location.</p><p><strong>Why PGSharp?</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-4.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>This tool is safe and secure to use, plus it offers a real map interface, and it is difficult for Niantic to catch it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Avoid-Being-Banned-From-Spoofing"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Avoid-Being-Banned-From-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Avoid Being Banned From Spoofing"></a>Part 2: How to Avoid Being Banned From Spoofing</h2><p>There are tricks that help you save from the Pokémon Go ban.</p><ul><li>First, you need to use a reliable tool like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone for iOS to spoof the GPS. By doing so, Niantic can’t catch you.</li><li>Never use a modified game or third-party client to catch Pokémon. You never know the client may be a worker in the developer’s office. Therefore, you will get caught easily.</li><li>You need to be very careful about your movement in the game. If you are using a fake GPS app, then make sure your movements are reasonable. It means do not switch long-distance locations in few hours or frequently. It is because this makes it unreal in Niantic radar and may cause you a problem.</li><li>Finally, do not root your Phone, be it Android or iPhone. It is because when you root your device, its security gets compromised, and it is easy to get data about your device’s fake location. And, your Pokémon Go account also can be at risk.</li></ul><p>Therefore, in order to catch special and maximum Pokémon, you do not need to cheat the game, only PGSharp is enough. With this, you can play the game just by sitting at your home. All you need to do is install PGSharp on your device and launch it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-makes-PGSharp-best-app-to-spoof-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-3-What-makes-PGSharp-best-app-to-spoof-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What makes PGSharp best app to spoof Pokémon Go"></a>Part 3: What makes PGSharp best app to spoof Pokémon Go</h2><p>The features and functions of PGSharp make it a safe spoofing app for Pokémon Go.

The mock location of Dr.Fone lets you simulate your position and permits your mobile application to presume that you have selected the application interface of Dr.Fone without any restrain or recognition from developers of Pokémon Go. Follow the instructions below to catch Pokémon any place without making any movement.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install:</strong></p><p>Install the ‘Dr. Fone toolkit’ from the official website after downloading it. After installation, launch the toolkit and select the ‘Virtual Location’ tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Connect:</strong></p><p>Subsequently, connect your PC or laptop with the Dr. Fone application. Also, permit the location services to retrieve the location of your device. Then, press on the ‘Get Started’ button to use the services of Dr. Fone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Imitate your GPS position:</strong></p><p>Select your current location on the map. Next, click the leftmost button on the top-right corner of the window to start the ‘Teleport’ mode. Then search the places you wish to mock your position with, and press ‘Go’ after the selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="virtual location 8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Imitate Movement between steps:</strong></p><p>To start the simulation, make a movement and traverse to the ‘Move Here’ button to reach multiple times. By default, the motion is adjusted to ‘1’, but it can be replaced by the user to switch the program correspondingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="virtual location 9"                ></p><p>The simulated position will emerge as genuine for the Pokémon Go app, and it will believe that you are moving between the two designated positions chosen on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the motion speed can also be tuned using the sliding menu. This way, you can use the false maneuver of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without having the need to understand it. Also, your application will not be banned.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="virtual location 10"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="virtual location 11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:</strong></p><p>Dr. Fone’s application also permits you to replicate activity between more than two sites. The component is called after the multi-stop path that can be chosen from the GUI toolbox class positioned at the top-right nook that lets you put numerous specified destinations on the map, and your position will behave appropriately as controlled by the virtual location application of Dr.Fone.</p><p>To grant permission to the system to mock movement by picking out the right options, press the ‘March’ button.

It is original since each and every other Pokémon has been announced in either the main games or using the Pokémon animation.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Is-Mega-Mewtwo-The-Strongest-Pokemon-On-Apple-iPhone-13"><a href="#Is-Mega-Mewtwo-The-Strongest-Pokemon-On-Apple-iPhone-13" class="headerlink" title="Is Mega Mewtwo The Strongest Pokémon On Apple iPhone 13?"></a>Is Mega Mewtwo The Strongest Pokémon On Apple iPhone 13?</h2><p>With the introduction of Pokémon Red and Blue and the following cartoon series, Charmander, Bulbasaur, and Squirtle to name a few have become cultural icons. However, there’s no Pokémon that can match the enthusiasm that fans of the series get on seeing Mewtwo. In this post, we’re going to talk about Mega Mewtwo X &amp; Y. So, read on to find out how to evolve into a shiny version of Mewtwo and tips to get this Pokémon.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Mega-Mewtwo-In-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Mega-Mewtwo-In-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Mega Mewtwo In Pokémon?"></a>Part 1: What Is Mega Mewtwo In Pokémon?</h2><p>Mewtwo is a Psychic-type Legendary Pokémon that’s introduced in Gen 1. Though it is not known for evolving into or from any other Pokémon, Mewtwo is capable of Mega Evolving into different forms known as –</p><p>Mega Mewtwo X from Mewtwonite X<br>Mega Mewtwo Y from Mewtwonite Y<br>Mega Mewtwo X is bulkier and bigger than its normal state. On the other hand, Mega Mewtwo Y is lighter and smaller than its normal state.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Evolve-Into-Shiny-Mega-Mewtwo"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Evolve-Into-Shiny-Mega-Mewtwo" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Evolve Into Shiny Mega Mewtwo?"></a>Part 2: How to Evolve Into Shiny Mega Mewtwo?</h2><p>Mega Evolution was introduced in Pokémon X and Y and was then expanded with the introduction of Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. When specific Pokémon holds the right Mega Stone, they can do temporary Mega Evolutions in the battle. The Mega Evolutions provide the Pokémon massive stat boost and new capabilities.</p><p>Below is the step-by-step guide to help you learn how to evolve into Shiny Mega Mewtwo-</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You have to do some work before getting access to Mega Evolutions. Performing and finishing these tasks will help you get the item you require to perform Mega Evolutions. Acquire the Rumble Badge from Shalour Gym through defeating Korrina.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the peak of the Tower of Mystery after the fight and talk to Korrina to get the Mega Ring.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, it’s time to upgrade the Mega Ring. Well, the upgraded ring isn’t essential for all Mega Evolutions but is needed to locate the hidden Mega Stones. Professor Sycamore is going to upgrade your Mega Ring at the Anistar Sundial after defeating your opponent in Kiloude City. It’s not possible after you complete the main story.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In order to perform a Mega Evolution, the Pokémon needs to hold a special Mega Stone. These Mega Stones are unique to each Pokémon. Only some Pokémon can Mega Evolve with them and Mewtwo is one of them. For Mewtwo, the location of Mega Stones is Unknown Dungeon.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Give the Mega Stone to that corresponding Pokémon for holding as it is required for Pokémon to hold its Mega Stone in order to perform Mega Evolution.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You can perform Mega Evolution in battles and only one of your Pokémon can perform Mega Evolution per battle. Your Pokémon will remain in its Mega form until the fight is complete or it faints.</p><p>That’s how to evolve into Mega Mewtwo. As you can now see that the first and most important step is to beat Korrina in order to mega evolve.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Is-Mega-Mewtwo-Worth"><a href="#Part-3-What-Is-Mega-Mewtwo-Worth" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Is Mega Mewtwo Worth?"></a>Part 3: What Is Mega Mewtwo Worth?</h2><p>No other Pokémon is as all-powerful, immortal, and invincible as the Mewtwo from series of Pokémon. With his sheer psychic capabilities, Mewtwo is capable of controlling whoever he desires and whatever he desires, and it includes the Earth’s weather. In the latest additions, Mewtwo two Mega Evolutions placed him among the strongest and fastest Pokémon.</p><p>If Mewtwo performs Mega Evolution into one of its forms, it takes back its quite well-deserved position as the most powerful Pokémon, with a base stat of 780.</p><p>So, Yes!! Mega Mewtwo is the strongest Pokémon.</p><p>And if you’re one of those who love to collect Pokémon cards and thinking of getting M Mewtwo EX, then you should be probably wondering about its worth on the market. Isn’t, it right? Then, it starts at $9.99.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Get-Mega-Mewtwo-X-And-Y"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Get-Mega-Mewtwo-X-And-Y" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Get Mega Mewtwo X And Y?"></a>Part 4: How to Get Mega Mewtwo X And Y?</h2><p>In order to get or evolve into Mega Mewtwo X or Mega Mewtwo Y, you need a special Mega Stone for your Pokémon. In Part 2 of this post, we have given in-depth detail about how to get the job done. Nevertheless, below we have covered some other tips to catch Mega Mewtwo X And Y:</p><p>However, there would come a scenario when you find yourself in the need of changing location in your Pokémon game. For instance, Pokémon Go requires you to go out and discover different areas in order to get and catch Pokémons, many people seek ways to spoof their locations. And that’s when <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes in very handy. This app can help you trick all location-based apps on your Apple iPhone 13.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="virtual location 03"                ></p><p>To perform Mega Evolution, you need to beat gym leader, Korrina. And this creature uses 2 Fighting-type Pokémon and a Flying&#x2F;Fighting-type Pokémon. You should use fast and strong flying-type&#x2F;psychic-type Pokémon and attack in order to make fast work of these three.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning here that performing Mega Evolution of Mewtwo in Pokémon Go is yet not possible. Soon, Mewtwo will be in the list of Pokémon Go Mega Evolutions.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>That’s all on Mewtwo Mega Evolution. Yes, Mega Mewtwo is the strongest Pokémon. To perform its Mega Evolution, it must hold its own special Mega Stone - Mewtwonite X or Mewtwonite Y. Trainers have to wear a bracelet called Mega Ring and it can be acquired at the Tower of Mastery in Shalour City, but you need to defeat the Gym Leader for that. With both things accessible, you can select the Mega Evolution option with an attack. Keep in mind that only one Pokémon per trainer is capable of Mega Evolving during each battle. Once a Pokémon is in its Mega form, it remains in that form until the battle completes.</p><h2 id="Hacks-to-do-pokemon-go-trainer-battles-For-Apple-iPhone-13"><a href="#Hacks-to-do-pokemon-go-trainer-battles-For-Apple-iPhone-13" class="headerlink" title="Hacks to do pokemon go trainer battles For Apple iPhone 13"></a>Hacks to do pokemon go trainer battles For Apple iPhone 13</h2><p>With the launch of the Pokémon Go battle league, the trainer battles are seen as one of the options that can be used to compete and do it the hard way. As the name suggests it is a feature in Pokémon Go that lets you battle as a trainer against the other trainers. Pokémon Go trainer battles are a great way to enhance your skills as the rules are different from the gym and raid battles which are also a great feature of this game. The Pokémon CP limits are granted to each league from which the trainer needs to choose one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 1"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Point-of-Trainer-Battles-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Point-of-Trainer-Battles-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the Point of Trainer Battles in Pokémon Go?"></a>Part 1: What is the Point of Trainer Battles in Pokémon Go?</h2><p>The best part is that the teams are assembled by the trainers themselves. The point of the trainer battles is that a winning team is chosen while competing with the other players. The trainer battles Pokémon Go also lets the trainers choose the best players that would charge and power up Pokémon. Different spoils are embedded within the trainer battles and they all are worth trying. Once the trainer battles he is rewarded three times per day as a normal team leader. As an AI team leader, you can get the reward once every day.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 2"                ></p><p>Now you want to make sure that the charged attacks are learned and how they can be used as a weapon against the other players. The Pokémon should also be chosen as per the ability as different Pokémon have different charged attack ability overall. The Pokémon is of a different kind as all benefit from the charge attack in different states. It also means that you get to choose Pokémon like Tyranitar which will get you to through the battle with highly advanced skills. Typhlosion is a dual-type Pokémon and the raids which are done using it benefit the trainers as compared to single types.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-can-you-get-from-trainer-battles-Pokemon-go"><a href="#Part-2-What-can-you-get-from-trainer-battles-Pokemon-go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?"></a>Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?</h2><p>This part will deal with the rewards which the trainers will get for the battles which they will fight. There are three different types of rewards that you can win when it comes to trainer battles. These are as follows:</p><ul><li>Stardust</li><li>As of January 2019, the Rare Candy reward has also been introduced to make the battles more enchanting.</li><li>1 in 7 chance of Sinnoh Stone.</li></ul><p>No matter that you win or lose a battle these rewards are credited to your account. If you are playing with a computer the threshold to get the rewards is 1. If you are competing with the other players then the rewards can be earned thrice per day. Both the participants will get the same rewards but the abilities are different depending on the fact that whether you are a winner or loser. The Ace trainer medal and its acquaintance will also get the level up with each battle that you win. The other three medals will also get a level up as per a blog post from Niantic. These medals are as follows:</p><ul><li>Great League Veteran</li><li>Ultra League Veteran</li><li>Master League Veteran.</li></ul><p>The rematches that are done in the trainer battles also account for the leveling up in all the medals as well as the other rewards that are explained.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_3.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 3"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-CP-Matter-in-Trainer-Battles"><a href="#Part-3-Does-CP-Matter-in-Trainer-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Does CP Matter in Trainer Battles?"></a>Part 3: Does CP Matter in Trainer Battles?</h2><p>In Pokémon trainer battle it indeed matters and this is one of the basic phenomena that will take you and your team to the next level. The CP stands for combat power and it means the power of your Pokémon. As a trainer when you battle more and more the XP increases and the CP as well. This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pokémon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pokémon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pokémon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pokémon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pokémon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pokémon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you. Use candies and power up your Pokémon to a higher level. It will also ensure that you get the best results on the battlefield.

We’ll present a couple of ways to reach your goals below.</p><h3 id="Through-Pvp-Rewards"><a href="#Through-Pvp-Rewards" class="headerlink" title="Through Pvp Rewards"></a>Through Pvp Rewards</h3><p>One of the best ways to earn Stardust is through Player versus Player features. When you’re playing with other users, you can earn Stardust based on the number of your previous wins, your game level, and the PVP outcome.</p><p>For instance, if you’re a Rank 2, you can earn around 2,000 Stardust points by winning a battle, and if you’re Rank 24, the number increases to about 200,000. You can also use a Star Piece to multiply your winnings by 1.5.</p><p>Another method is to play with your friends, and the Stardust points can vary from 300 to 1000, depending on your opponent’s rank.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-3.jpg"                      alt="pvp in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Opening-Gifts"><a href="#By-Opening-Gifts" class="headerlink" title="By Opening Gifts"></a>By Opening Gifts</h3><p>Opening gifts is one of the main components of the Pokemon Go experience. You’ll get daily gifts you can open for free, earn valuable items, and support your gameplay. Each gift can carry a certain amount of Stardust particles, so you don’t have to do anything to accumulate these items.</p><p>The maximum Stardust you can get in one gift is 300, which may not seem like a lot. However, if you open your gifts regularly, you’ll have the desired Stardust amount in no time. You should also combine this method with others mentioned in this article for the best experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-4.jpg"                      alt="opening gifts in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Hatching-Pokemon"><a href="#By-Hatching-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="By Hatching Pokemon"></a>By Hatching Pokemon</h3><p>Hatching a Pokemon is also one of the essential parts of your Pokemon experience. Every time you hatch an egg, you’ll get Stardust points you can spend on numerous instances. The Stardust amount will depend on the egg itself; the higher the rank, the better the prices.</p><p>You can check out the list below to determine how much Stardust you’ll collect through your egg hatching:</p><ul><li>400–800 Stardust for hatching a 2km egg;</li><li>600–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 5km egg;</li><li>800–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 7km egg;</li><li>1600–3200 Stardust for hatching a 10km egg;</li><li>3200–6400 Stardust for hatching a 12km egg.</li></ul><p>You can also use the Star Piece item to multiply the Stardust amount by 1.5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-5.jpg"                      alt="eggs in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Catching-Pokemon"><a href="#By-Catching-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="By Catching Pokemon"></a>By Catching Pokemon</h3><p>Catching Pokemon is one of the most efficient ways of earning Stardust points. Each Pokemon has a base rate of 100 Stardust points, but you can earn more points depending on the Pokemon’s evolution stage. For instance, if the Pokemon is in the second stage, you’ll earn an additional 500 Stardust points.</p><p>Another thing you should look out for is specific Pokemon characters – some may carry more than 100 Stardust points as their base. For instance, you can get a whopping 2,100 Stardust points if you catch Audino, 950 for Garbodor, 1,000 for Chimecho, etc.</p><p>If you stay consistent and catch at least one Pokemon daily, you can get up to 9,000 Stardust points on the seventh day. Moreover, the first catch of the day will bring you an additional 1,800 points.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-6.jpg"                      alt="catch a pokemon"                ></p><h3 id="By-Claiming-Raid-Rewards"><a href="#By-Claiming-Raid-Rewards" class="headerlink" title="By Claiming Raid Rewards"></a>By Claiming Raid Rewards</h3><p>When the Boss enters your Gym, you may think it’s a stressful scenario. However, you should consider the bright side and fight to earn valuable rewards, such as Stardust points.</p><p>Once you and your team defeat the Boss, you can collect the prizes. You’ll win 1,000 Stardust points each time a Boss enters, even if it leaves the Gym without a fight.</p><p>If you defeat the boss, you’ll also get a chance to catch the Pokemon, which can bring you even more Stardust points!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-7.jpg"                      alt="a raid battle in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Getting-Rocket-Rewards"><a href="#By-Getting-Rocket-Rewards" class="headerlink" title="By Getting Rocket Rewards"></a>By Getting Rocket Rewards</h3><p>Rocket rewards are sets of items you get after fighting the Team Go Rocket. Each time you beat this criminal group, you’ll be rewarded with either 500 or 1,000 Stardust points, depending on whether you were fighting Grunt or Team Go Leader.</p><p>Additionally, if you ever face Giovanni, you’ll get 5,000 points for fighting and beating him.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-8.jpg"                      alt="rocket battle in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Earning-Research-Rewards-Through-Completed-Tasks"><a href="#By-Earning-Research-Rewards-Through-Completed-Tasks" class="headerlink" title="By Earning Research Rewards Through Completed Tasks"></a>By Earning Research Rewards Through Completed Tasks</h3><p>Each player will get their daily to-do list depending on their skill and game level. Once you enter the app, you can complete these daily tasks for Stardust points.</p><p>The amount of points you will win depends on the task’s difficulty and duration. However, you should complete all the daily tasks to accumulate as many consumables as possible.</p><p>For instance, if you’re on level 45, you can head to the Go Battle League 45 times to earn 4,500 Stardust points.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-9.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go research tasks"                ></p><h3 id="By-Visiting-the-Gym"><a href="#By-Visiting-the-Gym" class="headerlink" title="By Visiting the Gym"></a>By Visiting the Gym</h3><p>While on your daily walk in the Pokemon world, you should check out whether you can find some Gyms around you. If you do, stop by to hang around with some of the most precious Pokemon characters and give them a berry while you’re there.</p><p>You’ll earn 20 Stardust points for each berry you give a Pokemon. It may be the easiest way to earn and use these points for your experience. Plus, you’ll meet new characters and fully experience what the Pokemon world offers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-10.jpg"                      alt="giving berries to pokemon characters"                ></p><h3 id="Claim-Stardust-Quickly-in-Pokemon-Go-by-Using-Location-Spoofing"><a href="#Claim-Stardust-Quickly-in-Pokemon-Go-by-Using-Location-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Claim Stardust Quickly in Pokemon Go by Using Location Spoofing"></a>Claim Stardust Quickly in Pokemon Go by Using Location Spoofing</h3><p>If you live in a rural area and don’t get too many chances to walk around and catch Pokemon characters, you can use a classic trick of location spoofing.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Why-is-iPogo-not-working-On-Apple-iPhone-12-mini-Fixed"><a href="#Why-is-iPogo-not-working-On-Apple-iPhone-12-mini-Fixed" class="headerlink" title="Why is iPogo not working On Apple iPhone 12 mini? Fixed"></a>Why is iPogo not working On Apple iPhone 12 mini? Fixed</h2><p>The popular iPogo app is one of the best free apps you can use to spoof on your device while playing Pokémon Go. It is equipped with an abundance of features that allows players to get way ahead in the game by spotting spawns early, catching gym raids, discovering nests and quest events, and so on. If you spot a Pokémon which is way too far from your location, you can use iPogo to fake your virtual coordinates and trick Pokémon Go to think you are nearby that area. Sounds like an amazing app to use right? But, there is a downside to it too as users of the app have repeatedly reported of iPogo not working. The app seems to overload and malfunction after a few hours of repeated usage. This issue is preventing users from harnessing the full potential of their gaming experience.</p><h3 id="Why-Users-download-iPogo"><a href="#Why-Users-download-iPogo" class="headerlink" title="Why Users download iPogo?"></a>Why Users download iPogo?</h3><p>iPogo is a free to use Pokémon Go++ mod which can be downloaded as an APK file for your iOS devices. It features tools that can be used by players to play the game virtually anywhere in the world while also enhancing the gameplay experience. Few of these exclusive features have been mentioned in the list below;</p><ul><li>The Spin and Auto-cash feature can be used to capture Pokémon and throw a spinning ball without requiring a physical device.</li><li>With just one click you can manage your collection of stored items. It removes the cumbersome ordeal of the game to manually select and delete items when you can erase all un-required items with just one tap.</li><li>If you are on the hunt for special shiny Pokémon, you can do so without having to go through dozens of non-shiny one’s. On activating the Auto-Runaway feature on your iPogo, you can skip through the time consuming animations of all non-shiny Pokémon.</li><li>You can augment the game to let your avatar walk continuously at a desired pace. The speed of your avatar’s movement can be adjusted using iPogo.</li><li>If there are unnecessary elements crowding up your screen, you can hide them temporarily.</li><li>You keep track of Pokémon spawns, quests and raids using the feed on your iPogo.</li></ul><p>With all these amazing benefits at hand, it seems almost unfair to not be able to make the best of it if iPogo keeps crashing or stops working. Let’s look into the probable reasons why your iPogo is not working and explore methods to solve this dilemma.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-problem-that-iPogo-is-not-working"><a href="#Part-1-Common-problem-that-iPogo-is-not-working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working"></a>Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working</h2><p>Pokémon Go players have made several reports of how iPogo is not functioning normally on their devices. For instance, while using the Plus mod on Pokémon Go, the Apple iPhone 12 mini device screen goes completely black and unresponsive making the game inaccessible. Also, devices that run Pokémon Go with iPogo seems to be running slower than those which do not use any helper or spoofing support.</p><p>Even if your device is able to withstand the load of using iPogo, it may still be possible to face other app related performance issues like ipogo enhanced-throw not working, ipogo joystick not working and ipogo feeds not working either. All these symptoms sums up the fact that the iPogo app is faltering on your device.</p><p>Read on to understand the reasons why your device is unable to run the iPogo mod smoothly;</p><ul><li>One of the root causes which explains why iPogo is crashing could be because you are utilizing too much of your phone’s system resource capacity. This means you have too many tabs or other applications opened on your device that is making the resource distribution falter leading to an automatic shutdown.</li><li>Another plausible reason could be that your iPogo application has not been properly installed. It is widely agreed upon that iPogo is a difficult app to install as it involves going through complex steps making it easier for mistakes to be made, eventually leading to a complete breakdown of the software.</li><li>Since installing iPogo is a cumbersome process, players would often resort to using downloading hacks to get the job done faster. However, not all such hacks can be relied upon as they may end up jail breaking your device or make your version of the app even more unstable.</li></ul><h3 id="Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue"><a href="#Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue" class="headerlink" title="Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue"></a>Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue</h3><p>It is often said that short cuts can cut you short or in this case, hacked! Disrupting the framework of your device is not price you should pay for enjoying the game at its best. Although, there are other safer and more reliable solutions to making the iPogo app run better on your iOS device. Let’s take a brief peak at some of them.</p><ul><li><strong>Limiting the usage of System Resources:</strong> Let’s keep in mind that it is unwise to keep too much on your plate and rightfully so. In this case, the more applications you keep active on your shortcut bar, the lesser resources your CPU has left to allocate to the iPogo app. Therefore, close off all other unnecessary applications before launching iPogo as it is already a heavy enough application to run on its own.</li><li><strong>Too many Items opened:</strong> Keep a tight check on your list of inventory while playing Pokémon Go using iPogo. Remember to delete all un-required collected items as it may be taking up too much space and wasting precious system resources.</li><li><strong>Keep you Device Clean:</strong> Not essentially in the literal sense but yes, it is indeed important to clean up your device often. Use a cleaner app that deletes and clears all those extra cache files that becomes the primary reason of system lag on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Install the Official Version:</strong> It may be tempting for anyone to install the app using shortcut hacks, but that’s all they are – just hacks! Installing iPogo seem like the long way but it is the right way on all accounts. There are three methods you can use to integrate the official iPogo app, all of which has been made more simplified.</li></ul><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Use the three-step app installation method which is direct and free to use.</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If you are opting for a matrix installation, in which case you will need a PC installed with either Windows, LINUX or MacOS.</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> The Signulous method is a premium mod that gives the player access to additional features.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> All of these installation methods have specific varied requirements which must be checked appropriately.</p><h2 id="Part-2-A-better-alternative-for-iPogo-virtual-location"><a href="#Part-2-A-better-alternative-for-iPogo-virtual-location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location"></a>Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location</h2><p>If using the iPogo mod to enhance your gaming experience on Pokémon Go seem less appealing with all the added hassle then there is a better alternative for you to use.

If you are wondering why there are certain types of Pokémon enlisted as ‘blanks’ in your Pokedex and you haven’t yet found them, it’s probably because they are marked as ‘regional’ types. This means that these Pokémon are exclusively locked in select regions around the world. Don’t Panic! You don’t have to spend a boat load of cash in order to catch these special regional Pokémon as there are tricks you can apply to catch them without even stepping out of your kitchen.</p><h2 id="Part-1-List-of-the-regional-Pokemon-that-have-been-announced"><a href="#Part-1-List-of-the-regional-Pokemon-that-have-been-announced" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced"></a>Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced</h2><p>Since the game publishers released these special regional Pokémon, they have been locked in their geo-specific locations around the world. There is a set or pair of regional Pokémon for each generation that has been introduced into the game. Regions may not be defined by real-time borders but are divided according to the type of the Pokémon and the place they are more likely to spawn.</p><p>These places may be specific to countries (Tauros spawn in the US), specific to a continent (Mr.Mime Spawn in Europe), specific to a region (Corsola spawn in the Tropics), and even certain halves of the planet (Lunastone and Solrock spawn in the Southern half and Northern half of the equator, respectively). These Pokémon are not necessarily rare spawn types. If you are traveling in their region, they may pop up quite frequently. You should take note that regional Pokémon won’t become available in Gyms or in Nests since they will only spawn in the wild. However, you can yet find them through eggs but only in their specific regions.</p><p>There are some exceptions among the regionals as well. These exceptions are known to swap their spawn locations or drop out of regional exclusivities like Zangoose and Seviper, or Minun and Plusle. Some regional Pokémon may also turn up in special in-game events like how Farfetch’d spawned during the 2017 Pokémon Go Travel Challenge.</p><p>If you are not a frequent traveler or know fellow trainers who are willing to trade their regional Pokémon then you may need to be patient and follow a few extra steps in order to get your hands on these rare types of Pokémon.</p><p>List of different Regional Pokémon – Where and How to Catch them All!</p><p>As of now, there are over 40 different regional Pokémon divided across generations that can be captured or hatched only in specific expanses of the world. There are of course occasional overlaps of Pokémon slipping out of their region and into other sectors. Let’s get into the list of all the region-specific Pokémon of different generations and where to find them.</p><h3 id="Gen-1-Kanto-Pokemon"><a href="#Gen-1-Kanto-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Gen 1&#x2F; Kanto Pokémon"></a>Gen 1&#x2F; Kanto Pokémon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/kanto-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="kanto pokemon"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Taouros:</strong> North America.</li><li><strong>Farfetch’d:</strong> Asia.</li><li><strong>Mr. Mime:</strong> Europe.</li><li><strong>Kangashkhan:</strong> Australia&#x2F;Pacific.</li></ul><h3 id="Gen-2-Johto-Pokemon"><a href="#Gen-2-Johto-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Gen 2&#x2F; Johto Pokémon"></a>Gen 2&#x2F; Johto Pokémon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/johto-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="johto pokemon"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Heracross:</strong> South America&#x2F; Southern Florida.</li><li><strong>Corsola:</strong> Equatorial Latitudes.</li></ul><h3 id="Gen-3-Hoenn-Pokemon"><a href="#Gen-3-Hoenn-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Gen 3&#x2F; Hoenn Pokémon"></a>Gen 3&#x2F; Hoenn Pokémon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/hoenn-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="hoenn pokemon"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Tropius:</strong> The Middle East and Africa.</li><li><strong>Torkoal:</strong> Southeast Asia.</li><li><strong>Volbeat:</strong> Europe, Australia, and Asia.</li><li><strong>Relicanth:</strong> The Cook Islands&#x2F;New Zealand.</li><li><strong>Solrock:</strong> Currently America and Africa.

When they spawn near your location, you catch it by throwing a Poke ball at it. If the Poke ball is seen shaking, it means that the Pokémon is resisting and may just pop out from the ball in which case you may have to throw another one at it. Now, if you are traveling and you have limited time or a number of spawns then here are a few tips you can utilize to enhance your chances of landing a catch.</p><ul><li><strong>Curve Ball:</strong> Practice your curveball throws. Throwing a curve ball automatically increases your chances of preventing a Pokémon from slipping through your hands, plus you also get a 17x bonus with each successful curve catch.</li><li><strong>Maximize your Medals:</strong> Medals increase your performance in the game without costing you any extra resources like Great balls, Ultra Balls, or Razz Balls. So, try and max out your medals to increase your chances of catching rare Pokémon, especially the exclusive ones.</li><li><strong>Keep Consistent:</strong> The algorithm of the game is quite complex but eventually, a pattern emerges. You will notice that if you keep practicing with great or excellent catches with the smaller (low XP) Pokémon, it increases your chances of catching the ones that put up a fight.</li><li><strong>Save your Berries:</strong> Feeding a Pokémon with Razz Berries increases your assurances of catching the Pokémon while also giving you a 15x bonus when you land a successful catch. Save your berries for those persistent Pokémon spawns.</li><li><strong>Use Powerful Poke balls:</strong> Last but definitely not least, use powerful balls like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball to maximize your chances of catching Pokémon. You should also remember that these are diminishable resources so use them wisely. On catching a Pokémon with a Great ball you will get 15x and with an Ultra ball you would get 2x so utilize them accordingly to catch rare and super rare Pokémon.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The journey to completing your Pokedex may not be a short one as there are hundreds of Pokémon out there, and even hundreds more yet to be introduced into the game. Traveling the world in search of the rarest regional Pokémon is meant to be a fun and exciting experience, yet it may not be viable for some who wish to enjoy the game to the fullest. Utilizing a fake GPS and VPN can bridge the gaps in your Pokedex and keep the game fun for you at the same time. So keep playing and catching Pokémon as there are loads of other exciting installments yet to be introduced by Niantic in the future.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-pokemons-for-pvp-matches-in-pokemon-go-for-apple-iphone-12-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Best Pokemons for PVP Matches in Pokemon Go For Apple iPhone 12 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-why-does-the-pokemon-go-battle-league-not-available-on-apple-iphone-15-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Why does the pokemon go battle league not available On Apple iPhone 15 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/here-are-some-pro-tips-for-pokemon-go-pvp-battles-on-apple-iphone-14-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Here are Some Pro Tips for Pokemon Go PvP Battles On Apple iPhone 14 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fix-pokemon-go-route-not-working-on-apple-iphone-xs-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Fix Pokemon Go Route Not Working On Apple iPhone XS Max?

But sometimes iPogo can’t install, and users face a lot of difficulties. At that moment, some users feel furious and look forward to the solutions to get rid of it. If you also hit in the same category, you are on the right page. Let’s discuss it more and look forward to the solution that will help you to install it again.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Reasons-that-you-can’t-install-the-ipogo"><a href="#Part-1-Reasons-that-you-can’t-install-the-ipogo" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Reasons that you can’t install the ipogo"></a>Part 1: Reasons that you can’t install the ipogo</h2><p>There are multiple reasons that contribute to the difficulty when you can’t install the iPogo. Some of them are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>iPhone version:</strong></li></ul><p>The current iPhone version you are choosing may be responsible for the problem for iPogo can’t install. It is important to have iOS version 13. It works on all the known jailbreak devices having the same iOS. In case you have upgraded the iOS 13 to iOS 14, the chances are quite less to use it.</p><ul><li><strong>iPogo version:</strong></li></ul><p>iPogo version is also an important factor of consideration. Time to time regular updates keep coming, and if you are stuck on the previous version, you will not be able to use it. Sometimes the iPogo is down whenever there is an update, and when you try to update it, the problem arises. At that moment, you need to be patient and try re-installation.</p><ul><li><strong>Direct download method:</strong></li></ul><p>If a user is considering direct downloading method, they might also face this trouble because Apple now targets certificate. Now you need to create your certificate with the help of a computer or a paid service like Signulous and others.</p><h3 id="Bonus-Simple-steps-to-install-iPogo"><a href="#Bonus-Simple-steps-to-install-iPogo" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: Simple steps to install iPogo"></a>Bonus: Simple steps to install iPogo</h3><p>To install iPogo, we suggest you avoid the direct download method and instead follow the steps to follow with “Matrix installer.”</p><p><strong>Steps to follow:</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Upgrade the iTunes version of your computer to latest version.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now remove the original app from your iDevice.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Get IPA from the website download and save it.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Launch the “Matrix Installer”.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> With the help of USB cable connect your Apple iPhone XS to the PC.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Let the installer to detect the iDevice.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Now click on “Device” then “Install Package” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/ipogo-install-package.jpg"                      alt="ipogo install package"                ></p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Now the installer asks for the Apple ID username, and Password mentions the same. Make sure these are the ones used to fetch the developer certificate from the Apple Server. (We suggest you create a new Apple ID)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/ipogo-install-enter-apple-id.jpg"                      alt="ipogo install enter apple id"                ></p><p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Be patient for a while and let the impact or to perform all the work.</p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> “Complete” message will appear and unlock your Apple iPhone XS Screen and move to “settings-&gt;General-&gt; device management.”</p><p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Now hit on the developer Apple ID and trust it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/ipogo-installing-click-trust.jpg"                      alt="ipogo installing click trust"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Risk-of-installing-ipogo-and-running"><a href="#Part-2-Risk-of-installing-ipogo-and-running" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Risk of installing ipogo and running"></a>Part 2: Risk of installing ipogo and running</h2><p>You can come across a certain risks also when you are installing and running iPogo.

This is because Google allows us to mock the location of our device using any reliable mobile app (unlike Apple). Therefore, if you are looking for an iSpoofer alternative for Android devices, you can follow these basic instructions.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Enable the Mock Location feature</strong></p><p>At first, you need to turn on the Developer Options to enable the Mock Location feature.

To win more matches and rank-up, players take the assistance of a Pokemon Go PvP tier list. With the help of a tier list, you can know what Pokemons to pick and identify some of the strongest contenders. In this post, I’m going to share dedicated Pokemon Go great, ultra, and master tier lists to help you pick the best Pokemons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-pvp-tier-list-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go pvp tier list banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-are-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-Lists-Evaluated"><a href="#Part-1-How-are-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-Lists-Evaluated" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How are Pokemon Go PvP Tier Lists Evaluated?"></a>Part 1: How are Pokemon Go PvP Tier Lists Evaluated?</h2><p>Before you go through our carefully calculated great, ultra, and master league Pokemon Go tier list, you should know some basics. Ideally, the following parameters are considered while placing any Pokemon in a tier list.</p><p><strong>Moves:</strong> The most important factor is the amount of damage any move can do. For instance, some moves like thunderbolt are more powerful than others.</p><p><strong>Pokemon type:</strong> The type of Pokemon also plays a vital role. You might already know that some Pokemon types can easily be countered while others have fewer counters.</p><p><strong>Updates:</strong> Niantic keeps updating Pokemon levels to have a balanced Pokemon Go PvP tier list. That’s why the current nerf or buff on any Pokemon would change their position in the list.</p><p><strong>CP levels:</strong> Since the three leagues have CP limits, the overall CP value of any Pokemon is also vital to place them in a tier list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-levels-pokemon-leagues.jpg"                      alt="cp levels pokemon leagues"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-A-Complete-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-List-Great-Ultra-and-Master-Leagues"><a href="#Part-2-A-Complete-Pokemon-Go-PvP-Tier-List-Great-Ultra-and-Master-Leagues" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Complete Pokemon Go PvP Tier List: Great, Ultra, and Master Leagues"></a>Part 2: A Complete Pokemon Go PvP Tier List: Great, Ultra, and Master Leagues</h2><p>Since Pokemon Go PvP matches are based on different leagues, I have also come up with Pokemon ultra, great, and master league tier lists to help you pick the most powerful Pokemon in every match.</p><h3 id="Pokemon-Go-Great-League-Tier-List"><a href="#Pokemon-Go-Great-League-Tier-List" class="headerlink" title="Pokemon Go Great League Tier List"></a>Pokemon Go Great League Tier List</h3><p>In Great League matches, the maximum CP of any Pokemon can be 1500. Considering this in mind, I have picked the following Pokemons from tier 1 (most powerful) to tier 5 (least powerful).</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Tier 1 (5/5 rating)</td><td>Altaria, Skarmory, Azumarill, and Glarian Stunfisk</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td>Tier 2 (4.5/5 rating)</td><td>Umbreon, Swampert, Lanturn, Stunfisk, Dexoxys, Venusaur, Haunter, Jirachi, Lapras, Mew, and Whiscash</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 3 (4/5 rating)</td><td>Ivysaur, Uxie, Alolan Ninetales, Scrafty, Mawile, Wigglytuff, Clefable, Marshtomp, and Skuntank</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 4 (3.5/5 rating)</td><td>Qwilfish, Dustox, Glalie, Raichu, Dusclops, Serperior, Minun, Chandelure, Venomoth, Bayleef, and Golbat</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 5 (3/5 rating)</td><td>Pidgeot, Slowking, Garchomp, Golduck, Entei, Crobat, Jolteon, Duosion, Buterfree, and Sandslash</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Pokemon-Go-Ultra-League-Tier-List"><a href="#Pokemon-Go-Ultra-League-Tier-List" class="headerlink" title="Pokemon Go Ultra League Tier List"></a>Pokemon Go Ultra League Tier List</h3><p>You might already know that in the ultra league, we are allowed to pick Pokemons of up to 2500 CP. Therefore, you can pick Tier 1 and 2 Pokemons and avoid the low-level Tier 4 and 5 Pokemons.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Tier 1 (5/5 rating)</td><td>Registeel and Giratina</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td>Tier 2 (4.5/5 rating)</td><td>Snorlax, Alolan Muk, Togekiss, Poliwrath, Gyarados, Steelix, and Blastoise</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 3 (4/5 rating)</td><td>Regice, Ho-Oh, Meltmetal, Suicune, Kingdra, Primeape, Cloyster, Kangaskhan, Golem, and Virizion</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 4 (3.5/5 rating)</td><td>Crustle, Glaceon, Piloswine, Latios, Jolteon, Sawk, Leafeon, Braviary, and Mesprit</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 5 (3/5 rating)</td><td>Celebi, Scyther, Latias, Alomomola, Durant, Hypno, Muk, and Roserade</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Pokemon-Go-Master-League-Tier-List"><a href="#Pokemon-Go-Master-League-Tier-List" class="headerlink" title="Pokemon Go Master League Tier List"></a>Pokemon Go Master League Tier List</h3><p>Lastly, in the Master League, we don’t have any CP limits for Pokemons. Keeping this in mind, I have included some of the most powerful Pokemons in Tier 1 and 2 here.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Tier 1 (5/5 rating)</td><td>Togekiss, Groudon, Kyogre, and Dialga</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td>Tier 2 (4.5/5 rating)</td><td>Lugia, Mewtwo, Garchomp, Zekrom, Metagross, and Melmetal</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 3 (4/5 rating)</td><td>Zapdos, Moltres, Machamp, Darkrai, Kyurem, Articuno, Jirachi, and Rayquaza</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 4 (3.5/5 rating)</td><td>Gallade, Golurk, Usie, Cresselia, Entei, Lapras, and Pinsir</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 5 (3/5 rating)</td><td>Scizor, Crobat, Electivire, Emboar, Sawk, Victini, Exeggutor, Flygon, and Torterra</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Catch-Powerful-Pokemons-Remotely"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Catch-Powerful-Pokemons-Remotely" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Catch Powerful Pokemons Remotely?"></a>Part 3: How to Catch Powerful Pokemons Remotely?</h2><p>As you can see from the top tier Great league Pokemon Go list that the tier 1 and 2 Pokemons can help you win more matches. Since catching them could be tough, you can take the assistance of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is a user-friendly application that would help you spoof your Apple iPhone 12 Pro location to catch any Pokemon remotely.</p><ul><li>With just a few clicks, you can easily change the present location of your Apple iPhone 12 Pro to any other place.</li><li>On the application, you can enter the target location’s address, name, or even its exact coordinates.</li><li>The application is extremely easy to use and provides a map-like interface to drop the pin to the exact target location.</li><li>Besides that, the tool can also help you simulate the movement of your device between multiple spots at any speed.</li><li>You can also use a GPS joystick to simulate your movement naturally and there is no need to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 12 Pro to use Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="virtual location 05"                ></p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>There you go! I’m sure that after going through this Pokemon Go PvP tier list, you would be able to pick the strongest Pokemons in every league match. If you don’t have Tier 1 and 2 Pokemons already, then I would recommend using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS). Using it, you can catch any Pokemon remotely from the comfort of your home without jailbreaking your device.</p><h2 id="Hacks-to-do-pokemon-go-trainer-battles-For-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro"><a href="#Hacks-to-do-pokemon-go-trainer-battles-For-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Hacks to do pokemon go trainer battles For Apple iPhone 12 Pro"></a>Hacks to do pokemon go trainer battles For Apple iPhone 12 Pro</h2><p>With the launch of the Pokémon Go battle league, the trainer battles are seen as one of the options that can be used to compete and do it the hard way. As the name suggests it is a feature in Pokémon Go that lets you battle as a trainer against the other trainers. Pokémon Go trainer battles are a great way to enhance your skills as the rules are different from the gym and raid battles which are also a great feature of this game. The Pokémon CP limits are granted to each league from which the trainer needs to choose one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 1"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Point-of-Trainer-Battles-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Point-of-Trainer-Battles-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the Point of Trainer Battles in Pokémon Go?"></a>Part 1: What is the Point of Trainer Battles in Pokémon Go?</h2><p>The best part is that the teams are assembled by the trainers themselves. The point of the trainer battles is that a winning team is chosen while competing with the other players. The trainer battles Pokémon Go also lets the trainers choose the best players that would charge and power up Pokémon. Different spoils are embedded within the trainer battles and they all are worth trying. Once the trainer battles he is rewarded three times per day as a normal team leader. As an AI team leader, you can get the reward once every day.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 2"                ></p><p>Now you want to make sure that the charged attacks are learned and how they can be used as a weapon against the other players. The Pokémon should also be chosen as per the ability as different Pokémon have different charged attack ability overall. The Pokémon is of a different kind as all benefit from the charge attack in different states. It also means that you get to choose Pokémon like Tyranitar which will get you to through the battle with highly advanced skills. Typhlosion is a dual-type Pokémon and the raids which are done using it benefit the trainers as compared to single types.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-can-you-get-from-trainer-battles-Pokemon-go"><a href="#Part-2-What-can-you-get-from-trainer-battles-Pokemon-go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?"></a>Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?</h2><p>This part will deal with the rewards which the trainers will get for the battles which they will fight. There are three different types of rewards that you can win when it comes to trainer battles. These are as follows:</p><ul><li>Stardust</li><li>As of January 2019, the Rare Candy reward has also been introduced to make the battles more enchanting.</li><li>1 in 7 chance of Sinnoh Stone.</li></ul><p>No matter that you win or lose a battle these rewards are credited to your account. If you are playing with a computer the threshold to get the rewards is 1. If you are competing with the other players then the rewards can be earned thrice per day. Both the participants will get the same rewards but the abilities are different depending on the fact that whether you are a winner or loser. The Ace trainer medal and its acquaintance will also get the level up with each battle that you win. The other three medals will also get a level up as per a blog post from Niantic. These medals are as follows:</p><ul><li>Great League Veteran</li><li>Ultra League Veteran</li><li>Master League Veteran.</li></ul><p>The rematches that are done in the trainer battles also account for the leveling up in all the medals as well as the other rewards that are explained.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_3.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 3"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-CP-Matter-in-Trainer-Battles"><a href="#Part-3-Does-CP-Matter-in-Trainer-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Does CP Matter in Trainer Battles?"></a>Part 3: Does CP Matter in Trainer Battles?</h2><p>In Pokémon trainer battle it indeed matters and this is one of the basic phenomena that will take you and your team to the next level. The CP stands for combat power and it means the power of your Pokémon. As a trainer when you battle more and more the XP increases and the CP as well. This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pokémon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pokémon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pokémon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pokémon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pokémon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pokémon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you. Use candies and power up your Pokémon to a higher level. It will also ensure that you get the best results on the battlefield. The weight and the size of the Pokémon also affect the CP score so you need a Pokémon that is both agile and lightweight to get the best results.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Tips-to-level-up-Pokemon-before-doing-the-Pokemon-go-trainer-battles"><a href="#Part-4-Tips-to-level-up-Pokemon-before-doing-the-Pokemon-go-trainer-battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Tips to level up Pokémon before doing the Pokémon go trainer battles"></a>Part 4: Tips to level up Pokémon before doing the Pokémon go trainer battles</h2><p>To get the best out of Pokémon Go battle another trainer it is advised to get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Let’s look at each of these leagues individually for a better understanding of the <strong>best Pokémon for PvP</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/everything-to-know-about-pvp-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon pvp battles"                ></p><h3 id="1-Great-League"><a href="#1-Great-League" class="headerlink" title="1. Great League"></a>1. Great League</h3><p>The Great League is the easiest league to jump into for beginners. Here, only Pokémon with 1,500 CP or less can join the battle. This low CP cap makes Pokémon with lower maximum CP shine, like Azumarill and Altaria. These Pokémon might not stand out in the other leagues, but in the Great League, they can dominate the battlefield.</p><h3 id="2-Ultra-League"><a href="#2-Ultra-League" class="headerlink" title="2.

Legendary Pokémon start making appearances here, with a focus on defensive power. Pokémon like Registeel and Cresselia excel in this league, but there are also many other Pokémon that hold their own valuable potential.</p><p>In the same way, Venusaur with Frenzy Plant and Swampert with Hydro Cannon are also popular choices in this league.</p><h3 id="3-Master-League"><a href="#3-Master-League" class="headerlink" title="3.

Pokémon like Groudon and Origin Forme Giratina are notable here, making them fit for any kind of battle.</p><p>Surprisingly, some Pokémon are not commonly picked for Raids, like Dialga and Altered Forme Giratina.

Ideally, you can partake in a Pokemon PvP battle locally or remotely. It is a 3 vs. 3 battle in which you have to select your best Pokemons to fight with other trainers. To help you become a PvP Poke master, I have come up with this detailed guide that will certainly come in handy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-pvp-battle-tips-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon pvp battle tips banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Pro-Strategies-to-Follow-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles"><a href="#Part-1-Pro-Strategies-to-Follow-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Pro Strategies to Follow in PvP Pokemon Go Battles"></a>Part 1: Pro Strategies to Follow in PvP Pokemon Go Battles</h2><p>If you want to be good at the Pokemon Go PvP battles, then you must understand how the game works. Once you are ready, I would recommend some of these Pokemon PvP strategies that are followed by pro players.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Start-from-the-low-leagues"><a href="#Tip-1-Start-from-the-low-leagues" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Start from the low leagues"></a>Tip 1: Start from the low leagues</h3><p>As you know, there are three different leagues to participate in Pokemon Go PvP battles. If you are a beginner or don’t have too many Pokemons, then you should start from the lower categories and gradually climb your way up. You can find these three categories in the PoGo PVP mode:</p><ul><li><strong>Great League:</strong> Max 1500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Ultra League:</strong> Max 2500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Master League:</strong> No CP limit</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/leagues-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="leagues in pokemon pvp"                ></p><p>The Master Leagues is mostly reserved for pro players since there is no CP limit for Pokemons. The Great League is the best category to learn and try different Pokemon combinations.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Master-all-the-Battle-Moves"><a href="#Tip-2-Master-all-the-Battle-Moves" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Master all the Battle Moves"></a>Tip 2: Master all the Battle Moves</h3><p>Ideally, there are four different moves in any PvP Poke battle that you must master. The more battles you partake in, the better you would become.</p><ul><li><strong>Fast attacks:</strong> These are the basic attacks that are done more frequently than others.</li><li><strong>Charge attack:</strong> Once your Pokemon has enough energy, you can do a charge attack that would do more damage.</li><li><strong>Shield:</strong> This would shield your Pokemon from the enemy attacks. In the starting, you would only get 2 shields per battle.</li><li><strong>Swapping:</strong> Since you get 3 Pokemons, don’t forget to swap them during the battle. You can only swap Pokemons once in every 60 seconds.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Check-your-Opponent’s-Pokemons"><a href="#Tip-3-Check-your-Opponent’s-Pokemons" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons"></a>Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons</h3><p>This has to be the most important thing that you should check before you start any Pokemon Go PvP battle. Right before starting the battle, you can check a list of the prospective opponents in your league. You can have a glimpse of their main Pokemons and pick your Pokemons accordingly so that you can counter their picks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/opponent-screen-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="opponent screen pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Know-the-current-Meta"><a href="#Tip-4-Know-the-current-Meta" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Know the current Meta"></a>Tip 4: Know the current Meta</h3><p>In nutshell, Meta Pokemons are the ones that are considered superior to other picks since they are more powerful. You might already know that some Pokemons are just stronger than others. Since Nintendo keeps balancing Pokemons with constant nerfs and buffs, you should do some research in advance.</p><p>There are several sources like the Silph Arena, PvPoke, and Pokebattler that you can check to know the current meta Pokemons.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Shield-Baiting-Strategy"><a href="#Tip-5-Shield-Baiting-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy"></a>Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy</h3><p>This is one of the most effective Pokemon Go PvP strategies that you must try. You might already know that there are two kinds of charged attacks a Pokemon can do (mild and strong). During the battle, you need to first poke your enemy and have enough energy for both moves.</p><p>Now, instead of going with your ultimate attack, only perform the mild one. Your opponent might assume that you are going for an ultimate and would use their shield instead. Once their shield is used, you can go for a stronger attack to win.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/shield-baiting-strategy-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="shield baiting strategy pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-6-Learn-to-Counter-Fast-Moves"><a href="#Tip-6-Learn-to-Counter-Fast-Moves" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves"></a>Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves</h3><p>To make the most of your shield and energy levels, you should learn how to counter moves. The first way to do this is by picking your Pokemons wisely. Your Pokemon would automatically get less damage if it can counter your opponent’s Pokemon.</p><p>During any PvP Poke battle, keep a count of your opponent’s moves to calculate when they would do a charged attack. Since you would only get 2 shields at the starting of the battle, make sure that you only use them at the time of need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/fast-moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="fast moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-7-Sacrifice-Swap"><a href="#Tip-7-Sacrifice-Swap" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap"></a>Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap</h3><p>This might sound surprising, but sometimes we have to sacrifice a Pokemon in a fight to win the battle. For instance, you can consider sacrificing a Pokemon that is at low energy and won’t be of much help later.</p><p>In this way, you can swap it in the battle and let it take all the charge attack of your opponent. Once the Pokemon is sacrificed and has drained the opponent’s Pokemon, you can place another Pokemon to claim the victory.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Changes-should-be-implemented-in-Pokemon-Go-PvP"><a href="#Part-2-What-Changes-should-be-implemented-in-Pokemon-Go-PvP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?"></a>Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?</h2><p>Even after the much-anticipated release of PoGo PvP, a lot of players are not satisfied with it. If Nintendo wants to improve Pokemon PvP and make their players happy, then the following changes should be made.</p><ul><li>The PvP Poke battles are based on the CP level of Pokemons instead of their IV levels, which is something most of the players dislike.</li><li>Nintendo should focus on making the battles smoother as a lot of players encounter unwanted bugs and glitches.</li><li>Apart from that, players also complain about unfair matchmaking in which pro players are often matched against beginners.</li><li>The overall pool of Pokemons is not balanced – if a player has meta Pokemons then they can easily win the game.</li><li>The PoGo PvP battles are more centric on the picks and less on the actual battle. Players would like more strategic moves and in-battle options to help them fight.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-iv-level-trick-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="cp iv level trick pokemon"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Select-the-Best-Pokemons-for-PvP-Battles"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Select-the-Best-Pokemons-for-PvP-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Select the Best Pokemons for PvP Battles?"></a>Part 3: How to Select the Best Pokemons for PvP Battles?</h2><p>During any Pokemon PvP battle, the type of Pokemons you pick can either make or break the results. Firstly, consider the following things in mind before you start any PvP Poke battle.</p><ul><li><strong>Team composition</strong></li></ul><p>Try to come up with a balanced team that would have both defensive and attacking Pokemons. Also, you should include Pokemons of different types in your team.</p><ul><li><strong>Focus on attacks</strong></li></ul><p>Presently, some attacks like thunderbolt are considered extremely strong in PoGo PvP battles. You should get to know about all the major attacks of your Pokemons to pick the best ones.</p><ul><li><strong>Consider Pokemon Stats</strong></li></ul><p>Most importantly, you should be aware of the defense, attack, IV, CP, and all the vital stats of your Pokemons to pick the best ones in the league of your choice. Besides that, you should also do some research about the Meta tier in Pokemon PvP to know the best picks of the present time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/meta-pokemons-in-pvp.jpg"                      alt="meta pokemons in pvp"                ></p><p>Most of the experts consider the following points while picking any Pokemon in PvP battles.</p><ul><li><strong>Lead</strong></li></ul><p>Firstly, focus on getting a Pokemon that can help you maintain a lead in the battle right from the start. You can consider getting Altaria, Deoxys, or Mantine as they are the strongest attackers.</p><ul><li><strong>Attacker</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to fight more aggressively in the Pokemon PvP battle, then consider getting some attackers like Bastiodon, Medicham, and Whiscash.</p><ul><li><strong>Defender</strong></li></ul><p>While making your Pokemon PvP team, make sure that you have at least one strong defender like Froslass, Zweilous, or Swampert.</p><ul><li><strong>Closer</strong></li></ul><p>In the end, make sure that you have a perfect Pokemon that can end the battle and secure a win. Pokemons like Azymarill, Umbreon, and Skarmory are some of the best closers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/skarmory-in-pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="skarmory in pokemon go"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Secrets-about-the-new-Mechanics-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles"><a href="#Part-4-Secrets-about-the-new-Mechanics-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles"></a>Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles</h2><p>Lastly, if you want to level up in PvP Poke battles, then you should get to know about these three important mechanisms.</p><ul><li><strong>Turns</strong></li></ul><p>Make sure that you keep an eye on the DTP and EPT values as they would indicate how much damage and energy is left. In the new mechanism, everything is about taking turns in 0.5 seconds. This will help you not only counter but also implement your moves before your opponent.</p><ul><li><strong>Energy</strong></li></ul><p>You might already know that every Pokemon starts with 100-value energy. While switching Pokemons, make sure that you remember their energy value as that would be retained later on. The energy value of every Pokemon will also help you make a charged move in time.</p><ul><li><strong>Switching</strong></li></ul><p>Switching is another strategic account in the new mechanism of Pokemon PvP battles in which we enter new Pokemons to the battle. Please note that the switching action has a 60-second cooldown window and you would only get 12 seconds to choose your next Pokemon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/mechanism-in-pokemon-pvp-battle.jpg"                      alt="mechanism in pokemon pvp battle"                ></p><p>There you go!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="iPogo-will-be-the-new-iSpoofer-On-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max"><a href="#iPogo-will-be-the-new-iSpoofer-On-Apple-iPhone-11-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max?"></a>iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max?</h2><p>If you are a sincere Pokemon Go player who sticks by the rules and plays the game, then you probably don’t know how hard it is to eliminate a location spoofer from the picture. The game attains new spheres and seems more interesting with a location spoofer involved. If you are an iOS user or an Android enthusiast who is eager for iSpoofer’s return or worried about iSpoofer Pogo not working, then this might just be the right article for you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-am-I-unable-to-download-iSpoofer-for-Pogo"><a href="#Part-1-Why-am-I-unable-to-download-iSpoofer-for-Pogo" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?"></a>Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?</h2><p>iSpoofer was discontinued two years ago, around 2019 and still remains out of action. This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application. The main target customers for iSpoofer were the PoGo players and having them gone, there is not much the app can offer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1"                ></p><p>The initial version remains unsupportive and shows ‘Maintenance’ pop up while you cannot download any new versions from their website. It still contains the old links on the site which are of no use to the current players. Tackling with too much will also result in account ban as Pokemon Go has strict rules that no third party applications will be entertained.</p><p>Since we haven’t heard from iSpoofer in 2020, we can assume that they won’t be here for long and it would be a wise choice to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Find-other-alternatives-for-the-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Find-other-alternatives-for-the-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer"></a>Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2"                ></p><p>It is hard to handle change especially when you are an iPhone user. There aren’t many apps that you can find on the App Store and you never know their authenticity. Even if you find a good location spoofer, you never know how long that is going to keep your location changed or if it will remain undetected. That being said - your first obvious option for spoofing Pokemon Go would be -</p><h3 id="Any-App-from-the-Apple-App-Store"><a href="#Any-App-from-the-Apple-App-Store" class="headerlink" title="Any App from the Apple App Store"></a>Any App from the Apple App Store</h3><p>If the iSpoofer for Pogo is not working, then you can make a simple search for some other GPS location changer on the App store and they would help you for a short time. If you are lucky then they might remain undetected for a very long time. However, we won’t suggest this to be the most stable option so we can move ahead to the next best thing for the iOS users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iOS-App-Store-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="iOS-App-Store-pic-3"                ></p><h3 id="In-built-spoofing-with-VPNs"><a href="#In-built-spoofing-with-VPNs" class="headerlink" title="In-built spoofing with VPNs"></a>In-built spoofing with VPNs</h3><p>Virtual Private Networks are known for masking your IP on the world wide web but what most of you don’t know is that they can also spoof your location. But this is only restricted to a few VPN applications that have the feature. SurfShark and ExpressVPn are two of the most affordable and efficient VPNs that you can consider for your iOS devices.</p><p>The spoofer will help you play Pokemon Go for sure though I cannot give you assurance about other games in the market. However, the detection rate is a problem because Pokemon Go is capable of detecting these VPNs and blocking your account if you don’t play your cards well. That is, you need to be careful about where you are ‘changing’ your location to (not too far).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4"                ></p><p>If you are looking for something long lasting and something that won’t pose a detection problem, then I would suggest you to go for WOnder share’s Dr.Fone. It is affordable, has some remarkable features and works great for both Android and iOS devices.</p><p>Unlike iSpoofer, this will not require jailbreak access, detects every location on the globe and poses no threat to your Pokemon Go account.

This is because evolutions take the gaming experience to another level. After being kept waiting, Pokémon Go players finally have a reason to put a smile on their faces. Pokémon Go has unleashed an important item for the evolution of generation 5 Pokémon in the Unova region. This item is called Unova Stone. In this article, we explain to you through every aspect and concept that pertains to Unova stone Pokémon go evolution.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Unova-Stone-Evolution"><a href="#Part-1-Unova-Stone-Evolution" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

It is a black and white item that is used to evolve certain Pokémon, specifically from Unova. This is akin Sinnoh Stone that was used to evolve Pokémon from Sinnoh Regio. However, Unova Stone is only capable of evolving Generation 5 Pokémon from the Unova region. It means you cannot use Unova Stones to evolve Pokémon from previous generations. Even though there are plenty of emerging Pokémon and Shiny Pokémon worth collecting, there are scores of trainers who understand the real value of adding Unova Stones to their inventory. By accumulating them, they can seamlessly achieve evolution with some Pokémon in the Unova region.</p><h3 id="How-Can-you-Obtain-Unova-Stone-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#How-Can-you-Obtain-Unova-Stone-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="How Can you Obtain Unova Stone in Pokémon Go?"></a>How Can you Obtain Unova Stone in Pokémon Go?</h3><p>Obtaining Unova Stone in Pokémon is now possible through research breakthroughs. But what exactly is research breakthroughs? Research breakthroughs are when a trainer completes seven research tasks with every research panning a day each. Here, the trainer only needs to complete the seven research pieces but not for seven straight days. This means it is possible to skip a day then resume your research until you complete seven of them without fail.</p><h3 id="Which-Pokemon-Require-Unova-Stone-to-Evolve-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Which-Pokemon-Require-Unova-Stone-to-Evolve-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Which Pokémon Require Unova Stone to Evolve in Pokémon Go?"></a>Which Pokémon Require Unova Stone to Evolve in Pokémon Go?</h3><p>As aforementioned, Unova Stone is used to evolve Pokémon only in the Unova region. Also, these Pokémon are of Generation 5. Some of these pre-evolution state Pokémon include:</p><p><strong>1. Pansage</strong></p><p>Pansage is a grass-type Pokémon originally found in the Unova region, Generation 5. It has a Max CP of 956, 104 attack, 94 defences, and 137 stamina in Pokemon Go.

Catching little cuddles and fighting to catch more-powerful Pokémon is really fun. In addition to fun, this game also increases your knowledge about the surrounding area and the diversity around your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-1.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>For example, if you want to catch the special characters or characters of another city, you have to that place. This is the only drawback for players. However, with location spoofing apps, you can catch characters from any location without actually moving there.</p><p>But, spoofing Pokémon Go is not easy, as Niantic keeps a close watch to spoofers. To spoof the Pogo, you will need trusted and safe spoofing apps like PGSharp for android and Dr.Fone virtual location for iOS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-2.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Let’s find out how PGSharp and Dr.Fone virtual location app save you from getting banned while spoofing Pokémon Go.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Ninatic-Policies-against-Spoofing"><a href="#Part-1-Ninatic-Policies-against-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Ninatic Policies against Spoofing"></a>Part 1: Ninatic Policies against Spoofing</h2><p>Getting banned for cheating Pokémon is nothing new. Niantic always modifies the policies to catch the spoofers and to maintain the originality of the game. Niantic has made a proper discipline policy with three strikes to punish the spoofers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-3.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Firstly, punishment:</strong> On the first fake strike, you will get a warning message, but you still can play the game. But, while plying, you will not be able to anything remotely for about seven days.</p><p><strong>Secondly, Punishment:</strong> On the second fake strike, Niantic may close your account temporarily for a month. It also gives you a warning message for future misuse of the game.</p><p><strong>Thirdly, Punishment:</strong> On the third strike, Niantic will ban the account for more than a month.</p><p>However, if you get caught regularly, the developer of Pokémon Go has the authority to permanently ban your account.</p><h3 id="Does-it-mean-you-can-never-spoof-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Does-it-mean-you-can-never-spoof-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Does it mean you can never spoof Pokémon Go?"></a>Does it mean you can never spoof Pokémon Go?</h3><p>No, you can spoof Pokémon Go with the best spoofing tools like PGSHarp and Dr.Fone virtual location.</p><p><strong>Why PGSharp?</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-4.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>This tool is safe and secure to use, plus it offers a real map interface, and it is difficult for Niantic to catch it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Avoid-Being-Banned-From-Spoofing"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Avoid-Being-Banned-From-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Avoid Being Banned From Spoofing"></a>Part 2: How to Avoid Being Banned From Spoofing</h2><p>There are tricks that help you save from the Pokémon Go ban.</p><ul><li>First, you need to use a reliable tool like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone for iOS to spoof the GPS. By doing so, Niantic can’t catch you.</li><li>Never use a modified game or third-party client to catch Pokémon. You never know the client may be a worker in the developer’s office. Therefore, you will get caught easily.</li><li>You need to be very careful about your movement in the game. If you are using a fake GPS app, then make sure your movements are reasonable. It means do not switch long-distance locations in few hours or frequently. It is because this makes it unreal in Niantic radar and may cause you a problem.</li><li>Finally, do not root your Phone, be it Android or iPhone. It is because when you root your device, its security gets compromised, and it is easy to get data about your device’s fake location. And, your Pokémon Go account also can be at risk.</li></ul><p>Therefore, in order to catch special and maximum Pokémon, you do not need to cheat the game, only PGSharp is enough. With this, you can play the game just by sitting at your home. All you need to do is install PGSharp on your device and launch it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-makes-PGSharp-best-app-to-spoof-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-3-What-makes-PGSharp-best-app-to-spoof-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What makes PGSharp best app to spoof Pokémon Go"></a>Part 3: What makes PGSharp best app to spoof Pokémon Go</h2><p>The features and functions of PGSharp make it a safe spoofing app for Pokémon Go. With PGSharp, you do not need to root or jailbreak your device. It is a safe and secure app for android users specially designed to spoof Pokémon Go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-5.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Now since you have PGSharp installed, you need to enable developer options on Android. For this, go to Settings &gt; About Phone&gt;build number.</p><p>Tap seven times on the build number to enable the developer options. Now, in the developer option, enable “Allow mock locations” and under it select PGSharp app as preferred mock location app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-6.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Remember to close all the background apps and launch PGSHARP.
