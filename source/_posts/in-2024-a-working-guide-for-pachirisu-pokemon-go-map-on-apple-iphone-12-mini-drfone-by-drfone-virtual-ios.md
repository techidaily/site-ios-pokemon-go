## A Working Guide For Pachirisu Pokemon Go Map On Apple iPhone 12 mini

_**“I have been trying to catch Pachirisu for a while now, but I can’t seem to locate it anywhere. Can someone tell me about a working Pachirisu Pokemon Go map?”**_

If you are also planning to catch this electric-type Pokemon, then you can have a similar query as well. Since Pachirisu is a region-specific Pokemon, chances are that you might not see it spawning everywhere. Though, if you use the right Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, then you can easily locate it. In this post, I’m going to suggest some working Pachirisu regional maps so that you can catch this Pokemon like a pro.

## Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu

### What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?

Due to the many tinkles around Pachirisu, this part will delve into every detail of this Pokemon. It’s a squirrel-like creature that can glide after spreading its arms. This electric-type Pokemon is region-exclusive and only available in the Sinnoh region. The best moves of Pachirisu are Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, which are perfect for defense and offense.

It's an EleSquirrel Pokemon that can win battles in rainy weather. Pachirisu is good against flying, steel, and electric-type Pokemon GO moves, whereas it is vulnerable to ground-type moves. This cute little guy would be an excellent pick in battles that can attack with fur balls.

You can evolve it into Mega Pachirisu with mega gems, but more evolution isn’t possible. Now, let's look at some stats in the table below to understand it better:

<table><tbody><tr><td><b>Pokemon No</b></td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td><b>Maximum CP</b></td><td>1372</td></tr><tr><td><b>Attack</b></td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stamin</b>a</td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td><b>Defense</b></td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td><b>Height</b></td><td>0.4m</td></tr><tr><td><b>Weight</b></td><td>3.9kg</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Where to catch Pachirisu?

As you know, some Pokemons like Pachirisu can be region-specific. Mostly, it is observed that Pachirisu is spawned in the northern regions of Canada, Alaska, and Russia. You can find it in the wildering, electric hubs, parks, and even some colder regions. Since it can hide pretty well, you would have to keep a keen eye to look for it. A Pokemon Go regional map for Pachirisu can further help you.

### Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?

As introduced before, Pachirisu is primarily found in areas of Alaska, Canada, and certain parts of Russia. If you are in one of these regions, you have a chance to encounter and catch Pachirisu in the wild.

As for providing specific coordinates for Pachirisu locations, it is important to note that Pokémon spawns can change frequently and depend on various factors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide fixed coordinates for Pachirisu encounters as they can vary over time.

To increase your chances of finding Pachirisu, it is recommended to visit areas with a higher likelihood of spawning regional exclusives, such as parks, tourist attractions, or areas with a diverse range of Pokémon spawns. Additionally, participating in Pokémon Go events or connecting with local Pokémon Go communities can provide valuable information on Pachirisu sightings in your region.

## Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You

Since Pachirisu is mostly spawned in Alaska, Canada, and Russia, you might need to take some extra measures to locate it. I would recommend these Pachirisu Pokemon Go spawn maps to assist you.

### 1\. The Silph Road

The Silph Road is the biggest crowd-sourced Pokemon Go map that will let you know about the recently spawning of Pachirisu. Since the directory has data about tons of Pokemons, you can go to its filters and select Pachirisu to save time. This will let you know the recent spawning of the Pokemon with its exact coordinates.

**Website:** [https://thesilphroad.com/](https://thesilphroad.com/)

### 2\. Poke Map

If you are looking for an active Pachirisu Pokemon Go map, then you can head to this freely available website. You can know the active regions where the Pokemon has been found recently. Not just that, it will also let you know about other details of the game like raids, Pokestops, gyms, etc.

**Website:** [https://www.pokemap.net/](https://www.pokemap.net/)

### 3\. PoGo Map

Earlier, PoGo Map was available as an app, but now you can only use its website to know the spawning of Pokemons. Since it is a global directory, you can easily use it as a Pachirisu map for Pokemon Go. You can zoom in to know the spawn location of Pachirisu with its coordinates or the exact address. Besides Pachirisu, it can also help you catch several other regional Pokemons as well.

**Website:** [https://www.pogomap.info/location/](https://www.pogomap.info/location/)

### 4\. PokeHunter

PokeHunter is a well-known Pokemon GO tracker that provides exact information on PokeStops and gyms. It will inform you about the Pachirisu, ex-Raid battles, and locations of other Pokémon characters. With real-time tracking, it is accessible to all devices, such as PCs and mobile phones. Besides, this map can show the energy level of Pokemon and let you decide which to catch.

## Part 3: How to Catch Pachirisu on Pokemon Go from Home?

If you don’t live in Canada, Alaska, or Russia, where Pachirisu is naturally spawned, then catching it can be tough. To make things easier, you can just use a location spoofer application. While there are plenty of mock GPS apps for Android devices, iPhone users often find it hard to spoof their device location. Well, in this case, I would suggest [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 12 mini location without jailbreaking it.

With just a few clicks, you can directly teleport to anywhere in the world by entering the location’s address or its coordinates. Furthermore, you can use the application to simulate your movement and even use its GPS joystick to move smoothly. Once you have noted the coordinates or address from the Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, you can follow these steps:

**Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 12 mini and launch the tool**

To start with, just launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) application on your computer and connect your Apple iPhone 12 mini to it. Grant the application the needed permissions, agree to the terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.

![virtual location 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 2: Teleport to any other location**

After when your device is detected, Dr.Fone will automatically display its exact location on the screen. You can now go to the Teleport Mode from the top-right to spoof your location.

![virtual location 03](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Now, go to the search bar and just enter the address of the target location or its coordinates that you can get from a Pachirisu Pokemon Go map.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Simply adjust the pin on the map so that you can drop it to the desired spot. Click on the “Move Here” button in the end to spoof your Apple iPhone 12 mini location.

![virtual location 05](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

**Step 3: Simulate your movement**

Furthermore, you can even simulate your device movement to ensure that you visit the correct Pachirisu Pokemon Go spawn map location. You can go to the one-stop or multi-stop mode on the screen and drop the pins on the map. This will form a route on which you can simulate your movement at the speed of your choice.

![virtual location 12](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png)

If you want to move naturally, then you can use the GPS joystick that would be enabled at the bottom of the screen. You can use your keyboard shortcuts or the mouse pointer to move in any route realistically.

## Where Is the Best Place to Catch Dratini On Apple iPhone 12 mini

Dratini is a rare Pokemon that can be found in the wild. It is a Dragon-type Pokemon that evolves into Dragonair and then into Dragonite. Dratini is a popular Pokemon among players due to its rarity and powerful evolution. If you are looking to catch Dratini on your Apple iPhone 12 mini, you may be wondering where the best place to find them is.

Dratini is one of the Pokémon creatures that resemble a snake. It has an elongated blue body with a blue white underside. It carries three-pronged fins on each side of its head which are white in color. Dratini also has a white bump on the forehead.

Dratini has an energy level that is constantly increasing, which makes it grow and can reach a length of more than 6 feet. It sheds its skin every time it has to grow, and usually hide behind a waterfall when shedding. The colony of Dratini lives underwater, living at the bottom feeding on food that falls from the upper levels. Outrage is the signature move for this Pokémon creature.

## Part 1: What’s the evolution of Dratini?

Dratini undergoes two different evolutions

The first un-evolved version is the serpentine Dratini that looks like a snake and continues shedding its skin as it grows. When you get to level 30, Dratini evolves into Dragonair, and at level 55 it becomes Dragonite

### Dragonair

This is an evolution of Dratini, which has a long scaly serpent-like body. It still retails the blue body with a white underside. The white bump on the forehead now becomes a white horn. The budding wings on the side of the head have now grown into full wings. It also carries three crystal orbs, with one on the neck and the other two on the tail.

Dragonair has the ability to stretch its wings so it can fly. It has a huge amount of energy in the body and can discharge the energy through the crystals. The energy that it releases has the ability to change the weather wherever it is. Dragonair can be found in seas and lakes.

### Dragonite

This is a Pokémon character that truly resembles a dragon and is the second evolution of Dratini. It has a yellow thick body, and a couple of antennae that come out of its forehead. It has a striated underbelly. The body is quite large when compared to the small wings.

Dragonite can fly at very high speeds despite its bulky appearance. It is a kindhearted Pokémon, which is as intelligent as a human being. It has been found to have tendencies to save humans from disasters, such as saving those who have come from a capsized ship on the high seas. It lives near the sea and is extremely rare in the Pokémon world.

## Part 2: Where can I find the Dratini nest?

Dratini is a Pokémon that lives in the water. Since it loves lakes and seas, you can find it when you visit areas that are near water. For example, in the United States, the most famous nests for Dratini are found in North Eastern San Francisco, Pier 39 and Pier 15. You will always find Dratini at these sites and they are famous for people who want to farm Dratini.

You may also g West to Squirtle Nest where you can get a lot of Dratini.

Dratini has a 5% spawning chance every day, so if you have the time, you can spend it on these sites as you enjoy the watery view and wait for it to appear.

Dratini nests can also be found in other parts of the world, such as Tokyo, Japan; Sydney and New South Wales, Australia; Paris, France and others.

## Part 3: Are the Dratini nest and spawn spot in the same place?

This is quite a common question for those who are new to the Pokémon universe. Basically, Dratini nests and spawn points are the same for a period of two weeks. The nests then migrate leaving the spawn points to spawn different types of Pokémon.

If the Dratini nest migrates, it can still come back in the future. You should always keep an eye at the spawn point where you first encountered your first Dratini Nest; it may come back once more and you can continue farming Dratini.

Dratini nests will migrate on alternate Thursdays at midnight. The nest migrations are random, so make sure that you visit and hit them many times over the two weeks in order to get the most Dratini that you can.

## Part 4: How to increase the possibility of earning Pokémon Go Dratini?

As mentioned earlier, Dratini can be found in certain places around the world. If you live outside these regions, you cannot be able to get Dratini. The best way to go about getting Dratini in such cases is to virtually relocate your device. This means that you can take your device to Tokyo nest sites even if you live in Africa.

The best app to use for teleportation is [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

**Features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)**

- Instantly teleport to an area where a Dratini nest has been found and remotely collect as many as you can.
- Use the joystick feature to move around the map until you come across Dratini.
- The app allows you to seem to be walking, riding a bike, or in a vehicle, on the map. This simulates real-time travel data, which is important when playing Pokémon Go.
- Any app that relies on geo-location data can safely use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for teleportation.

**A step-by-step guide to spoof your location using Dr.Fone Virtual Location (iOS)**

On the official Dr.Fone page, download and install Dr.Fone on your computer or you can click the Download button below to download it directly. Launch it and then go to the Home screen and click on “Virtual Location”.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

After entering the virtual location module, connect your iOS device to your computer using an original USB cable.

Next, click on “Get Started”; you will now be able to start the spoofing process.

![virtual location 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

Looking at the map, you can now see the actual location of your device. If the coordinates are not the correct ones, go to the bottom of your computer screen and click on the “Current Virtual location” icon. This will instantly point to the current virtual location of your device.

![virtual location 03](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Now go to the top side of your computer screen and click on the third icon on the bar. This instantly puts you in “teleport” mode. Now enter the coordinates of the Dratini nest that you have located. Hit the “Go” button and your device will instantly be teleported to the coordinates you entered.

The image below shows an example of coordinates entered for Rome, Italy.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Once you have successfully teleported your device, you will be able to navigate to the area where the Dratini nest has been found. You can use the joystick feature for this. You should also click on “Move here” so your location is permanently moved to that place.

You may now camp and keep hitting the Dratini nest so you can farm as many as possible within the two weeks before the nest migrates to another location.

Camping and looking for other Pokémon in the area will help you cool down and therefore avoid being banned from the game for spoofing your iOS device.

![virtual location 05](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

This is how your location will be viewed on the map.

![virtual location 06](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-06.png)

This is how your location will be viewed on another iPhone device.

![virtual location 07](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png)

## In conclusion

Dratini is one of the most friendly but rare Pokémon to get. It can evolve from a small serpentine worm, into a might, good-hearted dragon. This is one of the Pokémon that people love to farm for trading and taking part in raids and such events.

When you need to, you can teleport your device to an area where Dratini is popular using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) (iOS). Use the Dratini nest maps to find Dratini, and then visit the area or teleport there.

## How Can I Catch the Regional Pokémon without Traveling On Apple iPhone 12 mini

The main goal that the designers of Pokémon Go had in mind for the past few years was to create a framework that prompts players to get off their loungers and go into the real world in search of Pokémon. If you are wondering why there are certain types of Pokémon enlisted as ‘blanks’ in your Pokedex and you haven’t yet found them, it’s probably because they are marked as ‘regional’ types. This means that these Pokémon are exclusively locked in select regions around the world. Don’t Panic! You don’t have to spend a boat load of cash in order to catch these special regional Pokémon as there are tricks you can apply to catch them without even stepping out of your kitchen.

## Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced

Since the game publishers released these special regional Pokémon, they have been locked in their geo-specific locations around the world. There is a set or pair of regional Pokémon for each generation that has been introduced into the game. Regions may not be defined by real-time borders but are divided according to the type of the Pokémon and the place they are more likely to spawn.

These places may be specific to countries (Tauros spawn in the US), specific to a continent (Mr.Mime Spawn in Europe), specific to a region (Corsola spawn in the Tropics), and even certain halves of the planet (Lunastone and Solrock spawn in the Southern half and Northern half of the equator, respectively). These Pokémon are not necessarily rare spawn types. If you are traveling in their region, they may pop up quite frequently. You should take note that regional Pokémon won’t become available in Gyms or in Nests since they will only spawn in the wild. However, you can yet find them through eggs but only in their specific regions.

There are some exceptions among the regionals as well. These exceptions are known to swap their spawn locations or drop out of regional exclusivities like Zangoose and Seviper, or Minun and Plusle. Some regional Pokémon may also turn up in special in-game events like how Farfetch’d spawned during the 2017 Pokémon Go Travel Challenge.

If you are not a frequent traveler or know fellow trainers who are willing to trade their regional Pokémon then you may need to be patient and follow a few extra steps in order to get your hands on these rare types of Pokémon.

List of different Regional Pokémon – Where and How to Catch them All!

As of now, there are over 40 different regional Pokémon divided across generations that can be captured or hatched only in specific expanses of the world. There are of course occasional overlaps of Pokémon slipping out of their region and into other sectors. Let’s get into the list of all the region-specific Pokémon of different generations and where to find them.

## Part 2: How to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to catch Regional Pokémon

Catching regionally exclusive Pokémon requires you to travel to that location or region where the Pokémon is located, as it was originally intended by the game. Remember that Pokémon Go functions by tracking your location via GPS. Your GPS however, is a virtual means of tracking your IP address which can be faked using the right mock GPS and VPN. You can use a mock virtual location to fake your actual location and make it seem like you’re traveling around the world. The game itself would be tricked, allowing you to travel to regions and get your hands on those geo-exclusive Pokémon.

To get the best out of your mock location and also to avoid the risk of hitting a light ban on your account, [Dr.Fone Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) by Wondershare has been reviewed as a Mock GPS you can easily rely on. It offers a number of features that can come in handy while faking your location such as adjusting the speed so that it may seem like you’re actually traveling, you can use a 360-degree virtual joystick for manual control over your movements and you can also select specific routes on the map on which you want your in-game avatar to move on.

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

You can follow these easy steps to set up and access your Dr.Fone Virtual Location in an instant and teleport to anywhere in the world.

**Step 1: Download the Program**

Download Dr.Fone – Virtual Location. Install and launch the program. Click ‘Virtual Location’ to get access to the options window.

![virtual location 05](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

Once the location has been changed, you can center your GPS or move the location on your device, it will still be set to the location you have selected.

## Part 3: Tips to help catch Regional Pokémon

Catching regional Pokémon is just like catching any regular Pokémon. When they spawn near your location, you catch it by throwing a Poke ball at it. If the Poke ball is seen shaking, it means that the Pokémon is resisting and may just pop out from the ball in which case you may have to throw another one at it. Now, if you are traveling and you have limited time or a number of spawns then here are a few tips you can utilize to enhance your chances of landing a catch.

- **Curve Ball:** Practice your curveball throws. Throwing a curve ball automatically increases your chances of preventing a Pokémon from slipping through your hands, plus you also get a 17x bonus with each successful curve catch.
- **Maximize your Medals:** Medals increase your performance in the game without costing you any extra resources like Great balls, Ultra Balls, or Razz Balls. So, try and max out your medals to increase your chances of catching rare Pokémon, especially the exclusive ones.
- **Keep Consistent:** The algorithm of the game is quite complex but eventually, a pattern emerges. You will notice that if you keep practicing with great or excellent catches with the smaller (low XP) Pokémon, it increases your chances of catching the ones that put up a fight.
- **Save your Berries:** Feeding a Pokémon with Razz Berries increases your assurances of catching the Pokémon while also giving you a 15x bonus when you land a successful catch. Save your berries for those persistent Pokémon spawns.
- **Use Powerful Poke balls:** Last but definitely not least, use powerful balls like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball to maximize your chances of catching Pokémon. You should also remember that these are diminishable resources so use them wisely. On catching a Pokémon with a Great ball you will get 15x and with an Ultra ball you would get 2x so utilize them accordingly to catch rare and super rare Pokémon.

## Conclusion

The journey to completing your Pokedex may not be a short one as there are hundreds of Pokémon out there, and even hundreds more yet to be introduced into the game. Traveling the world in search of the rarest regional Pokémon is meant to be a fun and exciting experience, yet it may not be viable for some who wish to enjoy the game to the fullest. Utilizing a fake GPS and VPN can bridge the gaps in your Pokedex and keep the game fun for you at the same time. So keep playing and catching Pokémon as there are loads of other exciting installments yet to be introduced by Niantic in the future.
