## How Can I Catch the Regional Pokémon without Traveling On Apple iPhone 13

The main goal that the designers of Pokémon Go had in mind for the past few years was to create a framework that prompts players to get off their loungers and go into the real world in search of Pokémon. If you are wondering why there are certain types of Pokémon enlisted as ‘blanks’ in your Pokedex and you haven’t yet found them, it’s probably because they are marked as ‘regional’ types. This means that these Pokémon are exclusively locked in select regions around the world. Don’t Panic! You don’t have to spend a boat load of cash in order to catch these special regional Pokémon as there are tricks you can apply to catch them without even stepping out of your kitchen.

## Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced

Since the game publishers released these special regional Pokémon, they have been locked in their geo-specific locations around the world. There is a set or pair of regional Pokémon for each generation that has been introduced into the game. Regions may not be defined by real-time borders but are divided according to the type of the Pokémon and the place they are more likely to spawn.

These places may be specific to countries (Tauros spawn in the US), specific to a continent (Mr.Mime Spawn in Europe), specific to a region (Corsola spawn in the Tropics), and even certain halves of the planet (Lunastone and Solrock spawn in the Southern half and Northern half of the equator, respectively). These Pokémon are not necessarily rare spawn types. If you are traveling in their region, they may pop up quite frequently. You should take note that regional Pokémon won’t become available in Gyms or in Nests since they will only spawn in the wild. However, you can yet find them through eggs but only in their specific regions.

There are some exceptions among the regionals as well. These exceptions are known to swap their spawn locations or drop out of regional exclusivities like Zangoose and Seviper, or Minun and Plusle. Some regional Pokémon may also turn up in special in-game events like how Farfetch’d spawned during the 2017 Pokémon Go Travel Challenge.

If you are not a frequent traveler or know fellow trainers who are willing to trade their regional Pokémon then you may need to be patient and follow a few extra steps in order to get your hands on these rare types of Pokémon.

List of different Regional Pokémon – Where and How to Catch them All!

As of now, there are over 40 different regional Pokémon divided across generations that can be captured or hatched only in specific expanses of the world. There are of course occasional overlaps of Pokémon slipping out of their region and into other sectors. Let’s get into the list of all the region-specific Pokémon of different generations and where to find them.

## Part 2: How to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to catch Regional Pokémon

Catching regionally exclusive Pokémon requires you to travel to that location or region where the Pokémon is located, as it was originally intended by the game. Remember that Pokémon Go functions by tracking your location via GPS. Your GPS however, is a virtual means of tracking your IP address which can be faked using the right mock GPS and VPN. You can use a mock virtual location to fake your actual location and make it seem like you’re traveling around the world. The game itself would be tricked, allowing you to travel to regions and get your hands on those geo-exclusive Pokémon.

To get the best out of your mock location and also to avoid the risk of hitting a light ban on your account, [Dr.Fone Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) by Wondershare has been reviewed as a Mock GPS you can easily rely on. It offers a number of features that can come in handy while faking your location such as adjusting the speed so that it may seem like you’re actually traveling, you can use a 360-degree virtual joystick for manual control over your movements and you can also select specific routes on the map on which you want your in-game avatar to move on.

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

You can follow these easy steps to set up and access your Dr.Fone Virtual Location in an instant and teleport to anywhere in the world.

**Step 1: Download the Program**

Once the location has been changed, you can center your GPS or move the location on your device, it will still be set to the location you have selected.



## Part 3: Tips to help catch Regional Pokémon

Catching regional Pokémon is just like catching any regular Pokémon. When they spawn near your location, you catch it by throwing a Poke ball at it. If the Poke ball is seen shaking, it means that the Pokémon is resisting and may just pop out from the ball in which case you may have to throw another one at it. Now, if you are traveling and you have limited time or a number of spawns then here are a few tips you can utilize to enhance your chances of landing a catch.

- **Curve Ball:** Practice your curveball throws. Throwing a curve ball automatically increases your chances of preventing a Pokémon from slipping through your hands, plus you also get a 17x bonus with each successful curve catch.
- **Maximize your Medals:** Medals increase your performance in the game without costing you any extra resources like Great balls, Ultra Balls, or Razz Balls. So, try and max out your medals to increase your chances of catching rare Pokémon, especially the exclusive ones.
- **Keep Consistent:** The algorithm of the game is quite complex but eventually, a pattern emerges. You will notice that if you keep practicing with great or excellent catches with the smaller (low XP) Pokémon, it increases your chances of catching the ones that put up a fight.
- **Save your Berries:** Feeding a Pokémon with Razz Berries increases your assurances of catching the Pokémon while also giving you a 15x bonus when you land a successful catch. Save your berries for those persistent Pokémon spawns.
- **Use Powerful Poke balls:** Last but definitely not least, use powerful balls like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball to maximize your chances of catching Pokémon. You should also remember that these are diminishable resources so use them wisely. On catching a Pokémon with a Great ball you will get 15x and with an Ultra ball you would get 2x so utilize them accordingly to catch rare and super rare Pokémon.

## Conclusion

The journey to completing your Pokedex may not be a short one as there are hundreds of Pokémon out there, and even hundreds more yet to be introduced into the game. Traveling the world in search of the rarest regional Pokémon is meant to be a fun and exciting experience, yet it may not be viable for some who wish to enjoy the game to the fullest. Utilizing a fake GPS and VPN can bridge the gaps in your Pokedex and keep the game fun for you at the same time. So keep playing and catching Pokémon as there are loads of other exciting installments yet to be introduced by Niantic in the future.

So, read on to find out how to evolve into a shiny version of Mewtwo and tips to get this Pokémon.


## Part 1: What Is Mega Mewtwo In Pokémon?

Mega Mewtwo X from Mewtwonite X  
Mega Mewtwo Y from Mewtwonite Y  
Mega Mewtwo X is bulkier and bigger than its normal state. On the other hand, Mega Mewtwo Y is lighter and smaller than its normal state.

## Part 2: How to Evolve Into Shiny Mega Mewtwo?

Mega Evolution was introduced in Pokémon X and Y and was then expanded with the introduction of Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. When specific Pokémon holds the right Mega Stone, they can do temporary Mega Evolutions in the battle. The Mega Evolutions provide the Pokémon massive stat boost and new capabilities.

Below is the step-by-step guide to help you learn how to evolve into Shiny Mega Mewtwo-

**Step 1:** You have to do some work before getting access to Mega Evolutions. Performing and finishing these tasks will help you get the item you require to perform Mega Evolutions. Acquire the Rumble Badge from Shalour Gym through defeating Korrina.

**Step 2:** Go to the peak of the Tower of Mystery after the fight and talk to Korrina to get the Mega Ring.

**Step 3:** Now, it’s time to upgrade the Mega Ring. Well, the upgraded ring isn’t essential for all Mega Evolutions but is needed to locate the hidden Mega Stones. Professor Sycamore is going to upgrade your Mega Ring at the Anistar Sundial after defeating your opponent in Kiloude City. It’s not possible after you complete the main story.

**Step 4:** In order to perform a Mega Evolution, the Pokémon needs to hold a special Mega Stone. These Mega Stones are unique to each Pokémon. Only some Pokémon can Mega Evolve with them and Mewtwo is one of them. For Mewtwo, the location of Mega Stones is Unknown Dungeon.

**Step 5:** Give the Mega Stone to that corresponding Pokémon for holding as it is required for Pokémon to hold its Mega Stone in order to perform Mega Evolution.

**Step 6:** You can perform Mega Evolution in battles and only one of your Pokémon can perform Mega Evolution per battle. Your Pokémon will remain in its Mega form until the fight is complete or it faints.

That’s how to evolve into Mega Mewtwo. As you can now see that the first and most important step is to beat Korrina in order to mega evolve.

## Part 3: What Is Mega Mewtwo Worth?

No other Pokémon is as all-powerful, immortal, and invincible as the Mewtwo from series of Pokémon. With his sheer psychic capabilities, Mewtwo is capable of controlling whoever he desires and whatever he desires, and it includes the Earth’s weather. In the latest additions, Mewtwo two Mega Evolutions placed him among the strongest and fastest Pokémon.

If Mewtwo performs Mega Evolution into one of its forms, it takes back its quite well-deserved position as the most powerful Pokémon, with a base stat of 780.

So, Yes!! Mega Mewtwo is the strongest Pokémon.

And if you’re one of those who love to collect Pokémon cards and thinking of getting M Mewtwo EX, then you should be probably wondering about its worth on the market. Isn’t, it right? Then, it starts at $9.99.

## Part 4: How to Get Mega Mewtwo X And Y?

It’s worth mentioning here that performing Mega Evolution of Mewtwo in Pokémon Go is yet not possible. Soon, Mewtwo will be in the list of Pokémon Go Mega Evolutions.

## The Bottom Line

That’s all on Mewtwo Mega Evolution. Yes, Mega Mewtwo is the strongest Pokémon. To perform its Mega Evolution, it must hold its own special Mega Stone - Mewtwonite X or Mewtwonite Y.
