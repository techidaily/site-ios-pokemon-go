## Pok√©mon Go Cooldown Chart On Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max

Pok√©mon Go is a viral game; hence many people try to cheat to achieve high scores and invade others' privacy. The good news is that the Pok√©mon company is very responsive to preventing and combating such attacks. Cooldown Pok√©mon go another such feature to deter cheating. So let us discuss what cooldown means.

What is a cooldown? Cooldown Time restricts to stop a player from repeating multiple actions at different locations in a specified period.

## Part 1: What does Soft Banned & Cooldown Mean?

A soft ban is a restriction to discourage people from playing Pok√©mon Go while driving or moving. The three primary reasons for getting a soft ban are GPS spoofing, sharing accounts, and traveling fast. A soft ban is a temporary ban triggered when the Pok√©mon determines that the player cannot arrive within a period. So how do you know if you're soft-banned Pok√©mon go? A soft ban has some consequences, i.e., wasting tickets, no Pok√©mon guarding towers, no attacking Pok√©mon defending towers, etc.

What does cool down mean? Cooldown is the time a player has to wait after completing the in-game action. It is calculated from the distance you travel between the triggering activities. It depends on distance travel, and the time for cooldown is also high when the distance is high.

## Part 2: What Happens When You Get a Soft Ban?

When you get a soft ban, its duration is about 12 hours. In this period, any Pok√©mon you catch during the ban period will leave even if you use any ball type or berries. It also restricts you from winning gym fights and looting Pok√©stops. You can still keep playing Pok√©mon, though, as it is the most lenient form of ban.

## Part 4: The Safest Way to Teleport in Pok√©mon GO Without Getting Banned?

As we already discussed, teleport does not trigger soft ban or cooldown restrictions. So, it is a valid method of moving on without any risks.

Dr. Fone allows you to teleport anywhere in the world along with other unique features, including route simulation, GPS control, and unlimited choices of locations. Also, the new location gets active right away in the game.

It is a very simple-to-use application and provides robust results if you follow the guidelines. You have to make sure that the following best practices are followed, including;

- Always wait for the cooldown period to be over so that the game does not flag your account because of very fast movement and change of location. We have discussed the optimal cooldown time in the above section.
- Always log off from Pok√©mon before teleporting so the game does not detect your actions. For logging out, go to settings in your game by clicking the Pokeball in the center of the screen. Scroll down to locate and click the logout button.
