- **Rank 10:** If you finish at the highest rank, you will get a free avatar post and avatar items (Libre or Stone inspired)

## How to Get Battle League Pokemon Go Rewards?

To get more Pokemon Go league rewards, you need to rank-up by playing with other trainers and winning more matches. The battles take place under three primary leagues:

- **Great League:** Max 1500 CP for Pokemons
- **Ultra League:** Max 2500 CP for Pokemons
- **Master League:** No CP limit for Pokemons

Apart from that, three different cups would be organized in the season 5 Pokemon Go Battle League.

- **Little Cup (9th to 16th November):** Pokemons with only the first stage of evolution cycle and maximum CP of 500.
- **Kanto Cup (16th to 23rd November):** Pokemons from the Kanto index with a maximum CP of 1500.
- **Catch Cup (23rd to 30th November):** Pokemons that are caught from the starting of season 5 (excluding mythical Pokemons) of maximum 1500 CP.

![pokemon go battle leagues](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-battle-leagues.jpg)

When you start playing in Pokemon Go Battle League, Rank 1 would be unlocked. As you would keep winning more matches, your rank will improve. Though, to reach Rank 10, you also need an additional Go League Battle rating of 3000+.

## Tips to Level-up in Pokemon Battle Leagues

As stated, if you want to get more battle league Pokemon rewards, then you must level-up higher. Here are some of the tips that you can follow to level-up in the game easily.

### Tip 1: Have a Balanced Team

Most of the rookie PvP trainers make the common mistake of only picking attack-based Pokemons with fewer defense stats. Try not to make this mistake and have a balanced team in which you have both attacking and defensive Pokemons. Also, try to get Pokemons of different types to counter your opponent’s picks.

### Tip 2: Know the Current Meta Tier

Just like any other PvP game, Pokemon Go Battle Leagues also has a tier-list. That is, some Pokemons are just more powerful than others. Therefore, before you pick your Pokemons, get to know about the current meta-list. This will help you pick more powerful Pokemons that can easily carry a game.

### Tip 3: Catch More Pokemons Easily

Since it is not feasible to step out and look for Pokemons, you can use a location spoofer tool instead.

- The application has a map interface that would let you drop the pin anywhere you want in the world.
- Besides that, you can also simulate your movement between multiple stops at a preferred speed.
- A GPS joystick would also be enabled by the tool so that you can simulate your movement realistically.

## Part 1. How Do Routes in Pokemon Go Work?

The logic behind the Pokemon Go Routes is very simple. There are only two things you need to remember about it. First, you can record a walking path anywhere and submit it for review.

Of course, the quality and safety of the Route must be checked thoroughly before it becomes available to the public. Another thing about the Route is that you can use it to discover and explore new walking paths near you. All you need to do is pick your preferred Route and finish the entire trail. Afterward, you can obtain special rewards and extra bonus points upon its completion.

### There are no recorded Routes near your location

It’s possible that the Pokemon Routes are not showing up because you’re too far from them. Try to move around and see if the walking paths will finally appear on your radar. In this case, all you need to do is find the perfect spot where Routes are recorded.

### The Pokemon Go application has no adequate location access on your smartphone

![pokemon go location access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-5.JPG)

Is Pokemon Go Route not working on your end? Well, it’s possibly because the application has limited or restricted access to GPS on your smartphone. Don’t worry. It’s nothing serious. You can easily fix this kind of misconfiguration by adjusting your privacy settings.

### Your internet connection is unstable while playing Pokemon Go

Pokemon Go Routes and most of the game’s main features require a reliable internet connection. If you’re connected to slow and unstable internet access, the Pokemon Go app will not load up properly. That’s probably the reason why Pokemon Go Routes are not completing or working at all on your end.

### You’re using an outdated Pokemon Go app version

![update pokemon go app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-6.JPG)

Keep in mind that the Pokemon Go Routes is an additional game feature. That’s why you first need to update your existing Pokemon Go app before you can access it. The Routes is definitely not available to old versions of Pokemon Go mobile software.

### The current software version of your smartphone is not compatible with the Pokemon Go Routes feature

Android 6.0 and iOS 14 or higher are the main system requirements of the Pokemon Go application. The Pokemon Go Routes are not working, or perhaps the whole application malfunctions because your software version is too old. Don’t worry. A simple OS update might resolve this problem once and for all.
