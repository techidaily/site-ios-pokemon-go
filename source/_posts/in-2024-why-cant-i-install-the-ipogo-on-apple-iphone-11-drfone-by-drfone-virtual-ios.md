## Why can't I install the ipogo On Apple iPhone 11

For tweaking the official Pokemon Go app right there in AppStore, iPogo is a choice to have. But sometimes iPogo can’t install, and users face a lot of difficulties. At that moment, some users feel furious and look forward to the solutions to get rid of it. If you also hit in the same category, you are on the right page. Let’s discuss it more and look forward to the solution that will help you to install it again.

## Part 1: Reasons that you can’t install the ipogo

There are multiple reasons that contribute to the difficulty when you can’t install the iPogo. Some of them are as follows:

- **iPhone version:**

The current iPhone version you are choosing may be responsible for the problem for iPogo can’t install. It is important to have iOS version 13. It works on all the known jailbreak devices having the same iOS. In case you have upgraded the iOS 13 to iOS 14, the chances are quite less to use it.

- **iPogo version:**

iPogo version is also an important factor of consideration. Time to time regular updates keep coming, and if you are stuck on the previous version, you will not be able to use it. Sometimes the iPogo is down whenever there is an update, and when you try to update it, the problem arises. At that moment, you need to be patient and try re-installation.

- **Direct download method:**

If a user is considering direct downloading method, they might also face this trouble because Apple now targets certificate. Now you need to create your certificate with the help of a computer or a paid service like Signulous and others.

### Bonus: Simple steps to install iPogo

To install iPogo, we suggest you avoid the direct download method and instead follow the steps to follow with “Matrix installer.”

## Part 2: Risk of installing ipogo and running

You can come across a certain risks also when you are installing and running iPogo. These are as follows:

**Jailbreaking is required:**

For using iPogo, jailbreaking is required, and it refers to the privilege to Apple devices through which they can remove all the software restrictions. If there is any loss to the data, a user will be responsible for it.

**Chances to get banned:**

iPogo is an application that can be used after jailbreaking only. After doing the jailbreaking, the chances are there that your device might get banned. You are at a high risk where certain problems may arise.

**Can lose access to content:**

There might be a chance you have will lose access to content as well. Therefore we suggest you avoid. If you still want to jailbreak your device and want to install iPogo, it is entirely your choice.

## Part 3: is there a software like iPogo without jailbreak?

If you are wondering about the same question, then the answer is “Yes”. [Dr.Fone Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is an iOS location changer helping you to enjoy the same features without any hassle. This application will help you to simulate GPS movement along real road or paths you draw. A user can also integrate joystick to make the movement of GPS effortless. It helps you to teleport iPhone GPS to anywhere in the world. The best part is it supports up to five device location management at a time.

Let us understand how this tool can help you spoofing your location.

We are mentioning the steps which will help you to teleport to anywhere in the world. The steps for it are as follows:

**Step 1: Get the tool on PC**

Start with downloading Dr.Fone Virtual Location on your PC using the official website. And then install it. Once done, launch the program. Now hit on “Virtual Location” from all the options and connect your Apple iPhone 11 to the computer.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2: Get the Apple iPhone 11 device Connected**

You now need to get your iPgone plugged with PC via a USB cord. Once you do this, simply click on “Get Started.”

![virtual location 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3: Check Location Accuracy**

A new window will appear indicating the actual location on the map. If the location does not appear to be accurate hit on “Centre on” icon at the lower right part to get an accurate location.

![virtual location 03](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 4: Turn on Teleport Mode**

By clicking on the Corresponding icon in the upper right activates “Teleport Mode”. Now mention the place you want to teleport in the upper left field. Click “Go” (consider a Rome in Italy as an example)

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 5: Start Spoof**

After selecting it, the system will understand the desired place in Rome and hit on “Move here” in the popup box.

![virtual location 05](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

Finally, the location has been changed to Rome now. Whatever you do whether you click on “centre on” icon or try to relocate yourself on iPhone ROM is the fixed location that will appear, and in all the location app as well Rome is the fixed place.

## Conclusion

Here, we have agreed to do to the conclusion that if iPogo won’t install there is nothing for you to worry about because certain other solutions are there that help you to switch the locations without any hassle.

## iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Apple iPhone 11?

If you are a sincere Pokemon Go player who sticks by the rules and plays the game, then you probably don’t know how hard it is to eliminate a location spoofer from the picture. The game attains new spheres and seems more interesting with a location spoofer involved. If you are an iOS user or an Android enthusiast who is eager for iSpoofer’s return or worried about iSpoofer Pogo not working, then this might just be the right article for you.

## Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?

iSpoofer was discontinued two years ago, around 2019 and still remains out of action. This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application. The main target customers for iSpoofer were the PoGo players and having them gone, there is not much the app can offer.

![iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1.jpg)

The initial version remains unsupportive and shows ‘Maintenance’ pop up while you cannot download any new versions from their website. It still contains the old links on the site which are of no use to the current players. Tackling with too much will also result in account ban as Pokemon Go has strict rules that no third party applications will be entertained.

Since we haven’t heard from iSpoofer in 2020, we can assume that they won’t be here for long and it would be a wise choice to look for alternatives.

## Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer

![iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2.jpg)

It is hard to handle change especially when you are an iPhone user. There aren’t many apps that you can find on the App Store and you never know their authenticity. Even if you find a good location spoofer, you never know how long that is going to keep your location changed or if it will remain undetected. That being said - your first obvious option for spoofing Pokemon Go would be -

### Any App from the Apple App Store

If the iSpoofer for Pogo is not working, then you can make a simple search for some other GPS location changer on the App store and they would help you for a short time. If you are lucky then they might remain undetected for a very long time. However, we won’t suggest this to be the most stable option so we can move ahead to the next best thing for the iOS users.

![iOS-App-Store-pic-3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iOS-App-Store-pic-3.jpg)

### In-built spoofing with VPNs

Virtual Private Networks are known for masking your IP on the world wide web but what most of you don’t know is that they can also spoof your location. But this is only restricted to a few VPN applications that have the feature. SurfShark and ExpressVPn are two of the most affordable and efficient VPNs that you can consider for your iOS devices.

The spoofer will help you play Pokemon Go for sure though I cannot give you assurance about other games in the market. However, the detection rate is a problem because Pokemon Go is capable of detecting these VPNs and blocking your account if you don’t play your cards well. That is, you need to be careful about where you are ‘changing’ your location to (not too far).

![VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4.jpg)

If you are looking for something long lasting and something that won’t pose a detection problem, then I would suggest you to go for WOnder share’s Dr.Fone. It is affordable, has some remarkable features and works great for both Android and iOS devices.

Unlike iSpoofer, this will not require jailbreak access, detects every location on the globe and poses no threat to your Pokemon Go account. Here are the simple steps that you need to follow to work with [Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html) for spoofing location

## How to Use Pokémon Emerald Master Ball Cheat On Apple iPhone 11

One of the main goals of playing Pokémon is getting as many Pokémon as you can, training and evolving them so you can defeat any opposing trainers, and get to the top of the winning charts.

However, these Pokémon characters can be a little difficult to catch, especially in the wild. When you lob a Pokéball at a Pokémon, there are chances that it could escape.

What if there was a way in which you could catch a Pokémon creature every time, even Legendary Pokémon?

The Pokémon emerald master ball can do this with no effort on your part. Simply activate the ball and the Pokémon is captured. This makes the emerald Pokémon master ball a very important asset. In this article, you get to know all the Pokémon master ball cheat codes that you can use to get these valuable assets.

![An image of a Pokémon Master Ball](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/masterball-pokemon.jpg)

_**Tips:** Catch Pokémon like a Pro with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location! Capture as many Pokémon as possible within a short time, no matter where they appear. Explore different locations virtually and become a Pokémon-catching master! Try it now!_

## Part 1: Do you know the Pokémon Emerald Master Ball?

![The best ball to catch Pokémon – Pokémon emerald Master Raid Ball](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-emerald-ball.jpg)

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball is a unique Pokéball that is used to capture Pokémon creatures without fail. It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.

The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.

The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.

## Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.

The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.

## Part 4: Other tips to level up on Pokémon go

When you need to level up on Pokémon Go, the best and legal way is to get as much XP as possible within the shortest time possible. Now there are very many ways in which you can amass XP but we shall look at some of the best and easiest ways to go about this.

Here are a few of the best ways to go about this:

### Mass Friending

Having a lot of friends is not what gets you XP, but the quality of friends that you have. Here is what you get from having high-quality friends.

- 3,000 XP for a Great Friend
- 50,000 XP for an Ultra Friend
- 100,000 XP for a Best Friend

Timing the way your friendship levels up, and then dropping a Lucky Egg will hugely boost your XP. However, you can only use this process once for every friend per day. This method is great but it would take you 3 months for any friend to become a Best Friend.

### Mass Raids

Raiding Gyms can get you a lot of XP. This is more so when you go for Legendary Raids. You can get up to 10,000 XP for getting into a Legendary Raid. This becomes 20,000 XP if you have a Lucky Egg and 40,000 XP if you use a double XP event together with a Lucky Egg.

**How do you go about this?**

- Add up your stockpile of Premium Raid Passes
- Join a local Raid group through Facebook, WhatsApp, Discord, or other social networks that they use.
- Fix up a Raid Train, which is the process of moving from one Raid to another as a group, and this allows you to Raid as much as possible in a short time.

Do as many of these Raids as you can.

### Mass catching and Mass evolving

You can also catch as many Pokémon as you can and then use a Lucky Egg and their Candies to evolve them at the same time. This requires that you evolve many Similar Pokémon and they should be cheap to evolve. You can get a lot of XP in this way.

But how do you catch as many Pokémon as possible within a short time?

This is where teleporting tools such as [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) comes in.
