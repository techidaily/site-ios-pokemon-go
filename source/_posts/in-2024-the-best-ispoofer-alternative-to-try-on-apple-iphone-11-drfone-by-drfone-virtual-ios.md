## The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Try On Apple iPhone 11

_**“Is iSpoofer for Pokemon Go not working anymore? Can someone tell me how to spoof my iPhone X location now when the iSpoofer tool is shut down?”**_

If you have been using iSpoofer for a while to change your Apple iPhone 11 location, you can encounter a similar situation. Since iSpoofer is no longer available, users are actively looking for its alternative. In this post, I will let you know the iSpoofer use and why we can’t take its assistance to change the Pokemon Go location anymore. I will also make you familiar with the best iSpoofer alternative for iPhone and Android.

![ispoofer shutdown banner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-shutdown-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

Earlier, iSpoofer used to be one of the most popular apps to change our location on Pokemon Go. Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.

### Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

- The use of iSpoofer for Pokemon Go is against the terms of the game (as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party apps).
- Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.
- Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.
- Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.

![pokemon go account warning](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-go-account-warning.jpg)

### Will iSpoofer work again?

Most likely, the chances of iSpoofer working again are pretty bleak. This is because Pokemon Go users were the major target customers of the product. Since Niantic has blocklisted iSpoofer a while back, Pokemon Go players can no longer use it. Therefore, it is better to look for a reliable iSpoofer alternative instead.

You can follow these simple steps to use this iSpoofer alternative to change your Apple iPhone 11 location easily.

**Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 11 to the system**

To begin with, you can connect your Apple iPhone 11 to the system and launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location on it. Now, agree to its terms and click on the “Get Started” button.

![virtual location 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 2: Enter the target location**

Once your Apple iPhone 11 is detected, the interface will display its present location. You can now click on the teleport mode icon from the top.

![virtual location 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Now, please enter the address or the coordinates of the target location and load it on the map.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone 11 location**

As you would select the target location, the application will automatically change the interface. You can now drag the pin around and even zoom in/out the map to select the target location. Lastly, you can select the “Move Here” button and the location of your Apple iPhone 11 would be changed automatically.

![virtual location 5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

You can now launch Pokemon Go or any other GPS-based app to check the spoofed location of your Apple iPhone 11.

![virtual location 7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png)

**Note:** Keep in mind the cooldown duration before changing your location to ensure your account won’t get banned by Niantic while using the location spoofer. For instance, wait for a few minutes and only change your location realistically.



## Part 3: How to Spoof your Android Device’s Location for Pokemon Go?

Unlike iOS devices, it is pretty easy to spoof location in Android devices. This is because Google allows us to mock the location of our device using any reliable mobile app (unlike Apple). Therefore, if you are looking for an iSpoofer alternative for Android devices, you can follow these basic instructions.

**Step 1: Enable the Mock Location feature**

At first, you need to turn on the Developer Options to enable the Mock Location feature. For this, go to your phone’s Settings > About Phone and tap the “Build Number” seven times to turn on Developer Options.

![enable developer options](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/enable-developer-options.jpg)

Great! Now you can go to your phone’s Settings > Developer Options and turn on the Mock Location option.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 2: Install a Mock Location App**

Afterward, you can go to the Play Store and install any reliable mock location app from developers like Hola or Lexa. Let’s suppose we have installed the Mock GPS app by Lexa on the Apple iPhone 11 device.

![select mock location app](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-mock-location-app.jpg)

**Step 3: Change your device’s location**

That’s it! Now you can launch the mock location app and enter the address or coordinates of any target location. You can further adjust the pin and drop it anywhere you like to spoof the Apple iPhone 11 device’s location.

Since iSpoofer has been shut down, you can no longer use it to change your Apple iPhone 11 location.

They will make your game an absolute breeze, and you necessarily won’t move around as you play. Besides, Pokemon promo codes are short-lasting; you, therefore, need to claim them quickly.

## Part 1: How to Get Pokemon Go Promo Codes

Pokemon Go often offers promo codes on special events or after successful partnerships.

The availability of Pokemon promo codes is not constant – They do come and go.

Pokemon promo codes are unpredictable, and so are their rewards. Some promo codes will offer exceptional gifts such as cosmetics, while others may be in-game supplies such as Pokeballs and berries.

Niantic shares some free Pokemon Go promo codes on their official Twitter account. Their official statement on the website says, "Niantic offers a limited supply of one-time use codes in conjunction with special events or sponsored partnerships."

Pokemon Go also has daily free boxes, the ones you attain at no additional cost.

To check if you have received your daily free boxes, you need to glimpse at your store on a day-to-day basis.

With your free boxes, you can obtain different items.

## Part 2: The Latest Active Pokemon GO Promo Codes (January 2024)

The latest active **Pokemon Go promo codes** are less in number and are not readily available. However, here is the list of functional and usable Pokemon Go promo codes.

## Part 4: How to Cheat at Pokemon Go

The Pokemon Go promo code is not usually available at all times. However, this should not limit your play. You don’t necessarily have to move around for you to catch the Pokemon. You can still enjoy playing Pokemon Go in your comfort. You, therefore, have to involve a third-party tool. And the best software tool to use is Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This tool is an award-winning professional tool that allows you to teleport effortlessly. The key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location are:

- It has instant teleportation. It helps in concealing your GPS location
- It has a full-screen HD map view
- It has a joystick tool that comfortably allows you to spoof your location
- It will enable you to spoof your GRS location with a single click



Faking GPS location in iPhone devices differs from Android devices.

**iPhone devices --**

Here are the simple steps of using Dr. Fone - Virtual Location in faking your location on Pokemon Go on the iPhone.

**Step 1. Launch Dr. Fone Virtual Location to your computer.**

**Step 2. Link your Apple iPhone 11 to your computer**

![connect your phone and start to change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

Using a USB cable, connect your Apple iPhone 11 to your computer system. Hit the **‘Get started’** button to continue.

**Step 3. Search for a location**

![search for a location to fake](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Here, you need to search for a suitable location that you would like to teleport to. Hit the **‘teleport**’ option from the toolbar at the top-right corner of the interface.

**Step 4. Teleport to your desired location**

Various options of places you would like to teleport to will be there on display. You can search for it using the search bar or select one from the displayed list and hit the **‘Go’** icon.

**Step 5. Teleport to your chosen location**

For you to teleport to your chosen location, you need to drop a pin on your preferred place and hit the **‘Move Here’** icon. Now, you will be able to catch more Pokemon since you have already altered your location.

**Android Phones --**

Faking location on Android phones is undoubtedly more straightforward than on iPhones. In Android phones, hacking the GPS location does not necessarily involve using a computer device.

Here are the simple steps of how to fake your GPS location on Android devices.

**Step 1.  Enable the developer options**

![enable option to let developer mode be turned on](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokekom-go-teleport-safely-11.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622" border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
When you want to fake your location to allow you to play Pokemon Go freely, the first thing to do is unlock your developer options settings.

Go to the **‘Setting’** menu, which is usually at the top right corner of your interface. Scroll down and click on the **‘About Phone.’** Search for the **‘Build number’** option and click on it. Tap the build number about five times until a pop-up notification **‘You are now a developer’** appears.

**Step 2. Download the Fake GPS Location app to your Android device**

![download the fake gps location on your Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokekom-go-teleport-safely-13.jpg)

Go to the Google Play Store and download Fake GPS Location to your Android phone. Install it and allow it to run on your Android phone.

**Step 3. Allow mock location**

![wa stickers](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokekom-go-teleport-safely-12.jpg)

To get the Mock Location option, you go back to the **‘Settings’** menu. Scroll down search for **‘Allow Mock Locations’** and turn it on when you find it. Allow mocking of the Fake GPS app.

**Step 4. Search for your desired location to fake**

Go to your Fake GPS application and search for a preferred location. To initiate the process, hit the **‘Search’** bar.

**Step 5. Confirm your new location**

![search and confirm your new location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokemon-go-fake-gps-android-7.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Lastly, head back to your Pokemon Go app. There, you can see your new location cast.

### Conclusion

All **Pokemon promo codes** have an expiry time frame. And the time frames are usually shorter. Therefore, you need to use them before their due time elapses. Currently, there are no Pokemon promo codes. And for you to continue playing Pokemon Go, you need to involve a third-party tool, and the best tool to use is Dr. Fone Virtual Location.
