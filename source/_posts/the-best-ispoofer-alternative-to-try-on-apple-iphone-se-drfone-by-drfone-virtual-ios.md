## The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Try On Apple iPhone SE

_**“Is iSpoofer for Pokemon Go not working anymore? Can someone tell me how to spoof my iPhone X location now when the iSpoofer tool is shut down?”**_

If you have been using iSpoofer for a while to change your Apple iPhone SE location, you can encounter a similar situation. Since iSpoofer is no longer available, users are actively looking for its alternative. In this post, I will let you know the iSpoofer use and why we can’t take its assistance to change the Pokemon Go location anymore. I will also make you familiar with the best iSpoofer alternative for iPhone and Android.

![ispoofer shutdown banner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-shutdown-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

Earlier, iSpoofer used to be one of the most popular apps to change our location on Pokemon Go. Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.

### Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

- The use of iSpoofer for Pokemon Go is against the terms of the game (as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party apps).
- Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.
- Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.
- Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.

![pokemon go account warning](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-go-account-warning.jpg)

### Will iSpoofer work again?

Most likely, the chances of iSpoofer working again are pretty bleak. This is because Pokemon Go users were the major target customers of the product. Since Niantic has blocklisted iSpoofer a while back, Pokemon Go players can no longer use it. Therefore, it is better to look for a reliable iSpoofer alternative instead.

You can follow these simple steps to use this iSpoofer alternative to change your Apple iPhone SE location easily.

**Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone SE to the system**

To begin with, you can connect your Apple iPhone SE to the system and launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location on it. Now, agree to its terms and click on the “Get Started” button.

![virtual location 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 2: Enter the target location**

Once your Apple iPhone SE is detected, the interface will display its present location. You can now click on the teleport mode icon from the top.

![virtual location 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Now, please enter the address or the coordinates of the target location and load it on the map.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone SE location**

As you would select the target location, the application will automatically change the interface. You can now drag the pin around and even zoom in/out the map to select the target location. Lastly, you can select the “Move Here” button and the location of your Apple iPhone SE would be changed automatically.

![virtual location 5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

You can now launch Pokemon Go or any other GPS-based app to check the spoofed location of your Apple iPhone SE.

![virtual location 7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png)

**Note:** Keep in mind the cooldown duration before changing your location to ensure your account won’t get banned by Niantic while using the location spoofer. For instance, wait for a few minutes and only change your location realistically.



## Part 3: How to Spoof your Android Device’s Location for Pokemon Go?

Unlike iOS devices, it is pretty easy to spoof location in Android devices. This is because Google allows us to mock the location of our device using any reliable mobile app (unlike Apple). Therefore, if you are looking for an iSpoofer alternative for Android devices, you can follow these basic instructions.

**Step 1: Enable the Mock Location feature**

At first, you need to turn on the Developer Options to enable the Mock Location feature. For this, go to your phone’s Settings > About Phone and tap the “Build Number” seven times to turn on Developer Options.

![enable developer options](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/enable-developer-options.jpg)

Great! Now you can go to your phone’s Settings > Developer Options and turn on the Mock Location option.

![allow mock locations](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/allow-mock-locations.jpg)

**Step 2: Install a Mock Location App**

Afterward, you can go to the Play Store and install any reliable mock location app from developers like Hola or Lexa. Let’s suppose we have installed the Mock GPS app by Lexa on the Apple iPhone SE device.

![fake gps lexa](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-gps-lexa.jpg)

Once the app has been downloaded, you can again go to your phone’s Settings > Developer Options and set the app as a default tool to spoof your location.

![select mock location app](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-mock-location-app.jpg)

**Step 3: Change your device’s location**

That’s it! Now you can launch the mock location app and enter the address or coordinates of any target location. You can further adjust the pin and drop it anywhere you like to spoof the Apple iPhone SE device’s location.

![fake location on lexa](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-location-on-lexa.jpg)

There you go! After reading this post, I’m sure that you would be able to know about the iSpoofer use for Pokemon Go. Since iSpoofer has been shut down, you can no longer use it to change your Apple iPhone SE location. Therefore, you can consider [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) (iOS & Android) as an ideal iSpoofer alternative for your device. In just a few clicks, you can change the location of your Apple iPhone SE anywhere you like and that too without jailbreaking your phone.

Today, we will help you explore more about stardust trade costs and how can you easily perform trades! Hang on as we dwell deeper into Pokemon go and trade stardust costs.

## Part 1: How does Pokemon trading work?

So as we've discussed earlier, Pokemon go trading is one of the most interesting features of the game. So how does this trading work? In Pokemon Go, you can trade pokemon possessed by you with those possessed by your friends if both you and your friend, decide to mutually trade the pokemon with each other! For trading in Pokemon go, there are certain criteria you need to satisfy to qualify for trading in Pokemon go! Given below are the requirements to qualify for trading in Pokemon go

- Be at least level 10
- Be friends with the person you're trading on Pokemon go
- Be in a radius of 100 m while you're trading

However, Pokemon go also has levels of friendship and you can trade pokemon of different levels with friends with whom you have different friendship levels. Higher is the friendship level, higher is the level of Pokemon which you can trade. every trade requires you and your partner to spend stardust points. So There are basically 4 levels of friendship in Pokemon go

- Friend
- Good friend
- Ultra friend
- Best friend

The levels of your friendship with a player on Pokemon go increase with the increase in the number of days you stay friends with them. Within a month of friendship, you can become best friends with a player on Pokemon go! You also need stardust points on Pokemon go. So what is stardust trade cost? Before you trade any pokemon you must spend stardust coins. Not having enough stardust trade coins will not allow the trade of pokemon to happen. Hence, you must have enough stardust trade costs.

## Part 2: How much stardust do you need in pokemon trading costs?

Trading in Pokemon go is quite complex. This is because the needed Stardust points will be different in every case and will depend on several factors. Factors such as whether you already half got that Pokemon in your pokedesk or not, the friendship level of you and your friend who are interested in trading, or whether the Pokemon is rare or common. Given below are the Stardust trade costs for each Pokemon.

**Standard trades**

- Good friend:100
- Great friends:80
- Ultra Friends: 8
- Best friend: 4

**Shiny or legendary ( caught by you)**

- Good Friend: 1,000,000
- Great Friend: 800,000
- Ultra Friend: 80,000
- Best Friend: 40,000

However, this Stardust trade cost may vary according to the friendship levels! Before trading, you must think of the friendship level between you and your friend and also if the Pokemon which has been traded can be evolved through trading. Evolving Pokemon through trading is another beneficial tactic that could benefit you as a player of Pokemon go.
