## Is Mega Mewtwo The Strongest Pok√©mon On Apple iPhone XS?

So, read on to find out how to evolve into a shiny version of Mewtwo and tips to get this Pok√©mon.


## Part 1: What Is Mega Mewtwo In Pok√©mon?

Mewtwo is a Psychic-type Legendary Pok√©mon that‚Äôs introduced in Gen 1. Though it is not known for evolving into or from any other Pok√©mon, Mewtwo is capable of Mega Evolving into different forms known as ‚Äì

Mega Mewtwo X from Mewtwonite X

## Part 2: How to Evolve Into Shiny Mega Mewtwo?

Mega Evolution was introduced in Pok√©mon X and Y and was then expanded with the introduction of Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. When specific Pok√©mon holds the right Mega Stone, they can do temporary Mega Evolutions in the battle. The Mega Evolutions provide the Pok√©mon massive stat boost and new capabilities.

Below is the step-by-step guide to help you learn how to evolve into Shiny Mega Mewtwo-

**Step 1:** You have to do some work before getting access to Mega Evolutions. Performing and finishing these tasks will help you get the item you require to perform Mega Evolutions. Acquire the Rumble Badge from Shalour Gym through defeating Korrina.

**Step 2:** Go to the peak of the Tower of Mystery after the fight and talk to Korrina to get the Mega Ring.

**Step 3:** Now, it‚Äôs time to upgrade the Mega Ring. Well, the upgraded ring isn‚Äôt essential for all Mega Evolutions but is needed to locate the hidden Mega Stones. Professor Sycamore is going to upgrade your Mega Ring at the Anistar Sundial after defeating your opponent in Kiloude City. It‚Äôs not possible after you complete the main story.

**Step 4:** In order to perform a Mega Evolution, the Pok√©mon needs to hold a special Mega Stone. These Mega Stones are unique to each Pok√©mon. Only some Pok√©mon can Mega Evolve with them and Mewtwo is one of them. For Mewtwo, the location of Mega Stones is Unknown Dungeon.

**Step 5:** Give the Mega Stone to that corresponding Pok√©mon for holding as it is required for Pok√©mon to hold its Mega Stone in order to perform Mega Evolution.

**Step 6:** You can perform Mega Evolution in battles and only one of your Pok√©mon can perform Mega Evolution per battle. Your Pok√©mon will remain in its Mega form until the fight is complete or it faints.

That‚Äôs how to evolve into Mega Mewtwo. As you can now see that the first and most important step is to beat Korrina in order to mega evolve.

## Part 3: What Is Mega Mewtwo Worth?

No other Pok√©mon is as all-powerful, immortal, and invincible as the Mewtwo from series of Pok√©mon.

To perform Mega Evolution, you need to beat gym leader, Korrina. And this creature uses 2 Fighting-type Pok√©mon and a Flying/Fighting-type Pok√©mon. You should use fast and strong flying-type/psychic-type Pok√©mon and attack in order to make fast work of these three.

It‚Äôs worth mentioning here that performing Mega Evolution of Mewtwo in Pok√©mon Go is yet not possible. Soon, Mewtwo will be in the list of Pok√©mon Go Mega Evolutions.

## The Bottom Line

That‚Äôs all on Mewtwo Mega Evolution. Yes, Mega Mewtwo is the strongest Pok√©mon. To perform its Mega Evolution, it must hold its own special Mega Stone - Mewtwonite X or Mewtwonite Y. Trainers have to wear a bracelet called Mega Ring and it can be acquired at the Tower of Mastery in Shalour City, but you need to defeat the Gym Leader for that. With both things accessible, you can select the Mega Evolution option with an attack. Keep in mind that only one Pok√©mon per trainer is capable of Mega Evolving during each battle. Once a Pok√©mon is in its Mega form, it remains in that form until the battle completes.



## The Ultimate Guide to Get the Rare Candy on Pokemon Go Fire Red On Apple iPhone XS

In all Pokemon Go versions, a Rare Candy will automatically uplift you to the next level. These cadies are powerful and come with a lot of extra rewards. That said they are also very difficult to find, especially in Pokemon Fire Red. This article will show you some of the ways in which you can find Rare Cady, and level up quickly to improve your status in the game.

## Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pok√©mon Go Fire Red?

All Pokemon Go game variations have Rare Candy, and they are mainly used to upgrade the level of any Pokemon by 1. If you were at level 9, you automatically go up to level 10, etc. This will save you from having to engage in battles to raise your level. You may also earn the level attacks that you would have earned at that level, even without having to fight.

There are a limited number of Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red. However, you can get unlimited Rare Candies by using Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candy cheat codes through GameShark or Action Replay. You may also get them through cloning your existing Rare Cady.

When you use a Rare Candy, you get enough Exp. Points to move to the next level. This means that it is best to use them for getting to the next level, especially when it becomes too challenging. Although you get to the next level, you will not earn any Effort Value Points, which will make your Pokemon weaker than it would have been if you had leveled up through training.
