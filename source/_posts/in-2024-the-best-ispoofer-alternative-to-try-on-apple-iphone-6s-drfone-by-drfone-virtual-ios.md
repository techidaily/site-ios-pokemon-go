## The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Try On Apple iPhone 6s

_**“Is iSpoofer for Pokemon Go not working anymore? Can someone tell me how to spoof my iPhone X location now when the iSpoofer tool is shut down?”**_

If you have been using iSpoofer for a while to change your Apple iPhone 6s location, you can encounter a similar situation. Since iSpoofer is no longer available, users are actively looking for its alternative. In this post, I will let you know the iSpoofer use and why we can’t take its assistance to change the Pokemon Go location anymore. I will also make you familiar with the best iSpoofer alternative for iPhone and Android.

![ispoofer shutdown banner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-shutdown-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

Earlier, iSpoofer used to be one of the most popular apps to change our location on Pokemon Go. Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.

### Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

- The use of iSpoofer for Pokemon Go is against the terms of the game (as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party apps).
- Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.
- Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.
- Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.

![pokemon go account warning](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-go-account-warning.jpg)

### Will iSpoofer work again?

Most likely, the chances of iSpoofer working again are pretty bleak. This is because Pokemon Go users were the major target customers of the product. Since Niantic has blocklisted iSpoofer a while back, Pokemon Go players can no longer use it. Therefore, it is better to look for a reliable iSpoofer alternative instead.

You can follow these simple steps to use this iSpoofer alternative to change your Apple iPhone 6s location easily.

**Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 6s to the system**

To begin with, you can connect your Apple iPhone 6s to the system and launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location on it. Now, agree to its terms and click on the “Get Started” button.

![virtual location 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 2: Enter the target location**

Once your Apple iPhone 6s is detected, the interface will display its present location. You can now click on the teleport mode icon from the top.

## Part 3: How to Spoof your Android Device’s Location for Pokemon Go?

Unlike iOS devices, it is pretty easy to spoof location in Android devices. This is because Google allows us to mock the location of our device using any reliable mobile app (unlike Apple). Therefore, if you are looking for an iSpoofer alternative for Android devices, you can follow these basic instructions.

**Step 1: Enable the Mock Location feature**

At first, you need to turn on the Developer Options to enable the Mock Location feature. For this, go to your phone’s Settings > About Phone and tap the “Build Number” seven times to turn on Developer Options.
