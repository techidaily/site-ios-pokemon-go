## The Ultimate Guide to Get the Rare Candy on Pokemon Go Fire Red On Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max

In all Pokemon Go versions, a Rare Candy will automatically uplift you to the next level. These cadies are powerful and come with a lot of extra rewards. That said they are also very difficult to find, especially in Pokemon Fire Red. This article will show you some of the ways in which you can find Rare Cady, and level up quickly to improve your status in the game.

## Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?

All Pokemon Go game variations have Rare Candy, and they are mainly used to upgrade the level of any Pokemon by 1. If you were at level 9, you automatically go up to level 10, etc. This will save you from having to engage in battles to raise your level. You may also earn the level attacks that you would have earned at that level, even without having to fight.

There are a limited number of Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red. However, you can get unlimited Rare Candies by using Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candy cheat codes through GameShark or Action Replay. You may also get them through cloning your existing Rare Cady.

When you use a Rare Candy, you get enough Exp. Points to move to the next level. This means that it is best to use them for getting to the next level, especially when it becomes too challenging. Although you get to the next level, you will not earn any Effort Value Points, which will make your Pokemon weaker than it would have been if you had leveled up through training.

### There are no recorded Routes near your location

It’s possible that the Pokemon Routes are not showing up because you’re too far from them. Try to move around and see if the walking paths will finally appear on your radar. In this case, all you need to do is find the perfect spot where Routes are recorded.

### The Pokemon Go application has no adequate location access on your smartphone

![pokemon go location access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-5.JPG)

Is Pokemon Go Route not working on your end? Well, it’s possibly because the application has limited or restricted access to GPS on your smartphone. Don’t worry. It’s nothing serious. You can easily fix this kind of misconfiguration by adjusting your privacy settings.

### Your internet connection is unstable while playing Pokemon Go

Pokemon Go Routes and most of the game’s main features require a reliable internet connection. If you’re connected to slow and unstable internet access, the Pokemon Go app will not load up properly. That’s probably the reason why Pokemon Go Routes are not completing or working at all on your end.

### You’re using an outdated Pokemon Go app version

Keep in mind that the Pokemon Go Routes is an additional game feature. That’s why you first need to update your existing Pokemon Go app before you can access it. The Routes is definitely not available to old versions of Pokemon Go mobile software.

### The current software version of your smartphone is not compatible with the Pokemon Go Routes feature

Android 6.0 and iOS 14 or higher are the main system requirements of the Pokemon Go application. The Pokemon Go Routes are not working, or perhaps the whole application malfunctions because your software version is too old. Don’t worry. A simple OS update might resolve this problem once and for all.
