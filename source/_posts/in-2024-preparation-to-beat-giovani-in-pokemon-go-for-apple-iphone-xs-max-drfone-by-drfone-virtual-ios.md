## Preparation to Beat Giovani in Pokemon Go For Apple iPhone XS Max

Are you ready to defeat Giovani effortlessly in Pokemon Go? Keep reading.

Giovani is the grand commander of the Team Go Rocket crime syndicate. The big boss appears stronger every month as he also changes his lineup of creatures monthly. This means your lineup of Pokemon Go Giovani counters would have to change subsequently. So how do you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against the Team Go Rocket boss when next you meet him? Well, that's left for this guide to answer. Here you will learn about how to defeat this monster and how to find him. Without wasting your time, let's start with how to find Giovani in Pokemon.

## Part 1. How to Find the Giovani in Pokemon

Locating Giovani’s hideout is never a walk in the park as you need to complete some daunting tasks. A detailed explanation of each task is given below:

### 1\. A Troubling Situation Task

This four-step storyline Special Research task introduces players to the Team Go Rocket Invasion and Shadow Pokemon feature in the Pokemon Go game. Players leverage the task to learn how to stop the Team Go Rocket crime syndicate by reclaiming PokeStop and then purifying Shadow Pokemon.

How to Complete ’A Troubling Situation’ Task in Pokemon Go Giovani

Below you will find all the four steps you need to complete in the ‘A Troubling Situation’ task with their rewards:

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 1**

This step should be completed with ease since you aren't new to the Giovani Pokemon Go game. Just evolve any two Pokemon that you own and then charge them up five times. And boom! You are done with this step.

**Reward:** 1,000 Stardust and 2,000 XP

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 2**

For this step, you have to catch two shadow Pokemon which can be achieved by defeating two Grunts from Team Go Rocket. On killing them, they will leave some shadow Pokemon behind which you have to catch. After that, go ahead and defeat the last Grunt to complete this step.

**Reward:** 2,000 Stardust, 2,000 XP, and 5 Golden Razz Berries

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 3**

After catching the shadow Pokemon in step 2, you need to catch one more to cleanse or purify the three of them. To do this, just tap on your shadow Pokemon, and then hit the Purify option. You will be charged some thousands of Stardust and a couple of candy for the shadow Pokemon.

**Rewards:** 2000 Stardust, 5 Silver Pinap Berries, and 1 Rare Candy

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 4**

For this step, you’ve got nothing to do. All three objectives have been automatically completed for you when you finished the previous step. You only get rewards at this final step.

**Rewards:** One Fast TM, One Charged TM, and 3 Rare Candies

### 2\. Giovani Special Research Task

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
After completing the quest above, Giovani Special Research or Looming in the Shadows is the next and final quest you have to complete to face Giovani. It's a six-step Special Research that introduces the Team Go Rocket Grunts and Leaders: Cliff, Arlo, and Sierra.

![a troubling situation task](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/a-troubling-situation-task.jpg)

On completing one research step, you will be given a reward called the Super Rocket Radar. Like the Rocket Radar, the Super Rocket Radar can be equipped and unequipped from your Bag. This reward doesn't only show Giovani’s hideout, it also shows some of his Grunts hideouts.

## Part 2. What does the Pokemon Go Giovani Counter Contain?

Giovani remains the toughest beast amongst all the Team Go Rocket Leaders. When you find him in the game, be prepared to face his wrath. To defeat him, you need a powerful team.

The big boss choice of legendary Shadow Pokemon and second party members changes every month- the Pokemon you fought against the previous month will be different from that of the present month and thereafter.

Giovani’s lineup of creatures for October 2022 is shown below:

| Lineup of Creature | Pokemon |
| --- | --- |
| First | Persian |
| Second | Kangashkan, Nidoking, Garchomp |
| Third | Mewtwo |

For the Pokemon, Persian, and Kangashkan, try to have a Lucario, Conkeldurr, or Machamp in your team and you are good to defeat them.

When you encounter Nidoking or Garchomp, your team has to change. You will need to have a strong ice-type Pokemon on your team. The reason is that this new Lineup of creatures is strong on land and could cause substantial damage to the dragon-type Pokemon in case you wanna choose them.

Picking any of these great ice-type Pokemon, Mamoswine, Glaceon, or Weavile when you face Nidoking or Garchomp is a perfect choice. However, we recommend Mamoswine, because he isn't just an ice-type Pokemon but also a strong ground-type Pokemon.

Once you defeat Team Go Rocket's second lineup creatures, you will have to battle against the legendary psychic Pokemon, Mewtwo, who is weak to this set of Pokemon; bug, ghost, and Dark-type Pokemon. So beating this Pokemon Go Giovani grunt shouldn't be a tedious task as you’ve got a plethora of choices when deciding the Pokemon-type to use. Origin Giratina and Tyranitar are some strong Dark-type Pokemon you can use to defeat Mewtwo.

Now you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against each lineup of creatures, leverage it to advance to the next phase of the game where you will face the big bad boss himself, Giovani.

## Part 3. Tips to Beat Giovani in Pokemon Go

Just as you did against Team Go Rocket Leaders, Arlo, Cliff, and Sierra, you need a Pokemon stronger than two of Giovani’s. With that, you can use the same Pokemon twice, thereby keeping your choice for Legendary Shadow Pokemon safe till you need it to beat Giovani.

Mind you, the big bad boss, Giovani has two Protect Shields at his disposal so you have to be careful while fighting against the monster. We implore you to start your game with a Pokemon that has a Charged move so you can charge as fast as possible.

## Part 1: Will the iSpoofer back on 2020?

iSpoofer has been shut down. All its applications, websites, and other related services have been terminated. iSpoofer for pogo installation does not exist. If any website claims to give access to the application or iSpoofer direct download, it is fake. Also, the new Pokemon Go application version which is 0.195.0 has been updated to detect applications like iSpoofer, so on being detected, it may lead to a warning, or a permanent ban as well. And we don’t see the certainty to get it back soon.

## Part 3: How to use the iSpoofer when you play pokemon

Follow the tutorial above for ispoofer for pogo installation. A mock location has now been added to your device that makes iOS believe that you are at the entered spot.

![pokemon go ispoofer view](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-view.jpg)

Following these steps, disconnect your phone and launch Pokemon Go. From here you can either use the joystick to move around or use a “.gpx” file to add a preset route for you to move around. That would look like this -

![gpx file for preset route](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/gpx-file-for-preset-route.jpg)

iSpoofer for pogo installation has the following disadvantages -

- The application cannot work without iTunes and is very dependent on it.
- Niantic can easily detect spoofing through this app and may lead to a ban.
- Movement simulations are hard and unnatural, making it more susceptible to a ban.
- Configurations and settings require some technical knowledge in to troubleshoot any errors.
- The app is prone to crashing a lot. The interface sometimes cannot handle the constant change of locations.

All these issues are overcome with great detail by Dr. Fone Virtual Location (iOS) by Wondershare.

### How to find rare Pokémon or complete your Pokédex?

There are various options you can try to find rare Pokémon and complete your Pokedex.

- **Increase your trainer level.** The higher your trainer level is, the higher your chances of finding a rare Pokémon are. So, up your XP game by using lucky eggs, completing research quests, and catching more Pokémon.
- **Trade with other players.** If you have friends who also play Pokémon Go, you can trade rare and even legendary Pokémon with them. Just make sure you’re in a specific range with them.
- **Use incense and lures.** Both of these will help you attract more Pokémon. As for Lures, once they are used on a PokeStop, any player can enjoy its effects as a bonus.
- **Play on the Community Days.** If you’re looking to catch a Shiny Pokémon, don’t forget to play on community days. It is important because Shinies have a much higher rate of appearing during these days!
- **Have friends in other regions.** You cannot complete your Pokedex without getting region-exclusive Pokémon! Having friends from other regions ensures you can trade regional Pokémon with each other.
- **Use a virtual GPS at home.** If you don’t have anyone to trade your regional Pokémon with, you can use a virtual location. It can be achieved by using a specialized app, like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for this purpose to access rare locations and get more Pokémon!

Considering time and money, the first few of the above methods are not so easy to realize in practice. So here, we are exclusively introducing one of the most efficient and low-cost ways - virtual GPS to catch, power up, and evolve your Pokémon. Are you ready to complete your Pokedex faster?
