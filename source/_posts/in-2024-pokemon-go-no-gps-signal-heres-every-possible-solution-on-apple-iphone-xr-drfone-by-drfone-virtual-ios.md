This is one of the many queries that we have got lately about the Pokemon Go GPS problem. You would already know that without a stable GPS signal, you won’t be able to catch Pokemons or access other features of the game.

![pokemon go no gps signal banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/pokemon-go-no-gps-signal-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Common Reasons for Pokemon Go GPS Problems

Ideally, the Pokemon Go no GPS signal could be caused by either of these reasons:

- Chances are that the GPS feature on your device might not be functioning.
- Your phone might not be connected to an active internet connection.
- Pokemon Go could not have permission to access the location of your device.
- Your phone or the Pokemon Go app might not be loaded or started correctly.
- It could also happen if you are running an old or outdated version of Pokemon Go.
- There could be any other app or firmware-related issue causing this problem.

![pokemon gps signal not found](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/pokemon-gps-signal-not-found.jpg)

## Part 2: How to Fix Pokemon Go No GPS Signal Issue on iOS Devices?

If you own an iOS device and are facing the Pokemon Go GPS bug, then you can follow these troubleshooting tips.

### Fix 1: Enable the Location Services on your Phone

Before taking any drastic measures, make sure that the location services on your iOS device are enabled. You can just go to the Control Center and tap on the GPS icon to turn it on. Alternatively, you can also browse to its Settings > Privacy > Location Services and toggle on this feature.

![enable location services iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/enable-location-services-iphone.jpg)

After that, you can restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS Pokemon Go issue or not.

### Fix 2: Grant the Pokemon Go app Location Access

Turning on the location services on your Apple iPhone XR is not enough and you need to grant the GPS access to the Pokemon Go app. To fix the Pokemon Go GPS problem on your Apple iPhone XR, simply visit its Settings > Privacy > Location Services. Now, from the list of the installed apps, select Pokemon Go and make sure it can access the GPS on your Apple iPhone XR while running (or always).

![pokemon go location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/pokemon-go-location-services.jpg)

### Fix 3: Set Precise Location for Pokemon Go

In case the Pokemon Go GPS is not accurate on your Apple iPhone XR, then you can enable the “Precise Location” option for the app. This will make sure that Pokemon Go can access the exact location of your phone.

To fix these Pokemon Go GPS issues, you can go to your phone’s Settings > Privacy > Location Services and select Pokemon Go. From the location sharing option, make sure the Precise Location feature is enabled.

![iphone precise location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/iphone-precise-location.jpg)

### Fix 4: Step Into an Open Area

If you're currently in an area with poor GPS reception due to buildings or trees, try moving to an open area with a clear view of the sky. This can significantly improve your GPS signal strength.

### Fix 5: Restart the App and the Apple iPhone XR device

Lastly, you can just reload the Pokemon Go app or restart your Apple iPhone XR if you still get the Pokemon Go no GPS signal. You can just go to the app drawer and swipe up the Pokemon Go card to close the app.

![close pokemon go app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg)

You can also press the Power or the Side + Volume Up/Down keys (for newer models) to get the power option. Swipe it to turn off your device and press the Power/Side key afterward to restart your phone.

## Part 3: How to Fix the Pokemon Go No GPS Signal Issues on Android?

Just like iPhone models, fixing the Pokemon Go GPS problem on Android phones is pretty easy and can be done in the following way:

### Fix 1: Check the Location Services on your phone

Needless to say, the first thing that you should do is to check the location settings on your phone to fix the GPS Pokemon Go problem.

You can just slide down the Control Center and tap on the GPS button to enable the location services. Besides that, you can also go to your phone’s Settings > Locations and turn it on.

![android location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/android-location-services.jpg)

### Fix 2: Grant Location access to Pokemon Go

If you have not granted the location services permission to Pokemon Go, then you can get the no GPS signal error on it. To fix the Pokemon Go GPS issues, you can go to its Settings > Location > App-based Permissions and enable the GPS access for Pokemon Go.

![pokemon go location access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/pokemon-go-location-access.jpg)

### Fix 3: Reinstall the Pokemon Go App

As listed above, one of the reasons for this Pokemon Go GPS bug could be a corrupt or outdated app. The easiest way to fix this is by uninstalling Pokemon Go on your phone. Afterward, restart your phone and go to Play Store to install Pokemon Go on your Android again.

![pokemon go update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/pokemon-go-update.jpg)

### Fix 4: Set GPS on High Accuracy

## The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Try On Apple iPhone XR

_**“Is iSpoofer for Pokemon Go not working anymore? Can someone tell me how to spoof my iPhone X location now when the iSpoofer tool is shut down?”**_

If you have been using iSpoofer for a while to change your Apple iPhone XR location, you can encounter a similar situation. Since iSpoofer is no longer available, users are actively looking for its alternative. In this post, I will let you know the iSpoofer use and why we can’t take its assistance to change the Pokemon Go location anymore. I will also make you familiar with the best iSpoofer alternative for iPhone and Android.

![ispoofer shutdown banner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-shutdown-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

Earlier, iSpoofer used to be one of the most popular apps to change our location on Pokemon Go. Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.

### Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

- The use of iSpoofer for Pokemon Go is against the terms of the game (as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party apps).
- Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.
- Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.
- Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.

![pokemon go account warning](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-go-account-warning.jpg)

### Will iSpoofer work again?

Most likely, the chances of iSpoofer working again are pretty bleak. This is because Pokemon Go users were the major target customers of the product. Since Niantic has blocklisted iSpoofer a while back, Pokemon Go players can no longer use it. Therefore, it is better to look for a reliable iSpoofer alternative instead.

![ispoofer not working](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-not-working.jpg)

## Part 2: The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Change your Apple iPhone XR Location

- Since it is a 100% secure way to spoof your Apple iPhone XR location, your Pokemon Go account won’t be compromised in the process.
- You can spoof your device location to anywhere you want by entering the place’s address or coordinates using the application.

## Part 3: How to Spoof your Android Device’s Location for Pokemon Go?

Unlike iOS devices, it is pretty easy to spoof location in Android devices. This is because Google allows us to mock the location of our device using any reliable mobile app (unlike Apple). Therefore, if you are looking for an iSpoofer alternative for Android devices, you can follow these basic instructions.

**Step 1: Enable the Mock Location feature**

At first, you need to turn on the Developer Options to enable the Mock Location feature. For this, go to your phone’s Settings > About Phone and tap the “Build Number” seven times to turn on Developer Options.

![fake location on lexa](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-location-on-lexa.jpg)

There you go! After reading this post, I’m sure that you would be able to know about the iSpoofer use for Pokemon Go. Since iSpoofer has been shut down, you can no longer use it to change your Apple iPhone XR location. Therefore, you can consider [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) (iOS & Android) as an ideal iSpoofer alternative for your device. In just a few clicks, you can change the location of your Apple iPhone XR anywhere you like and that too without jailbreaking your phone.
