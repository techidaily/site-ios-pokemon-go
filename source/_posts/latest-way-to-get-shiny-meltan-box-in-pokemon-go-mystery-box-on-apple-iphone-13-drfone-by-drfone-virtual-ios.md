### Use Virtual Location to catch the Pokémon Go creature

You can use the faux location of [Dr. Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to imitate your orientation without making a move and collect exclusive Pokémon. The mock location of Dr.Fone lets you simulate your position and permits your mobile application to presume that you have selected the application interface of Dr.Fone without any restrain or recognition from developers of Pokémon Go. Follow the instructions below to catch Pokémon any place without making any movement.

**Step 1: Install:**

Install the ‘Dr. Fone toolkit’ from the official website after downloading it. After installation, launch the toolkit and select the ‘Virtual Location’ tab.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2: Connect:**

Subsequently, connect your PC or laptop with the Dr. Fone application. Also, permit the location services to retrieve the location of your device. Then, press on the ‘Get Started’ button to use the services of Dr. Fone.

![virtual location 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3: Imitate your GPS position:**

Select your current location on the map. Next, click the leftmost button on the top-right corner of the window to start the ‘Teleport’ mode. Then search the places you wish to mock your position with, and press ‘Go’ after the selection.

![virtual location 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

**Step 4: Imitate Movement between steps:**

To start the simulation, make a movement and traverse to the ‘Move Here’ button to reach multiple times. By default, the motion is adjusted to ‘1’, but it can be replaced by the user to switch the program correspondingly.

![virtual location 9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

The simulated position will emerge as genuine for the Pokémon Go app, and it will believe that you are moving between the two designated positions chosen on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the motion speed can also be tuned using the sliding menu. This way, you can use the false maneuver of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without having the need to understand it. Also, your application will not be banned.

![virtual location 10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png)

![virtual location 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 5: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:**

Dr. Fone's application also permits you to replicate activity between more than two sites. The component is called after the multi-stop path that can be chosen from the GUI toolbox class positioned at the top-right nook that lets you put numerous specified destinations on the map, and your position will behave appropriately as controlled by the virtual location application of Dr.Fone.

To grant permission to the system to mock movement by picking out the right options, press the 'March' button. You will be required to do the Pokémon Go walking illusion at some point. Dr. Fone's virtual movement imitation application eases your life and lets you do the job without being concerned about travel costs.

## Part 2: How to get Shiny Meltan in Pokémon Go?

Meltan is a legendary steel-type Pokémon that was initially launched in Pokémon Go. It is original since each and every other Pokémon has been announced in either the main games or using the Pokémon animation. Meltan has very restricted accessibility and Meltan evolution, Melmetal can yet solely be evolved in Pokémon Go. Until now, there were only two ways of catching Meltan - transferring a Pokémon from Pokémon Go to Pokémon Home or associating your Pokémon Go account to Let's Go, Pikachu! or Let's Go, Eevee! Now there is another way of capturing Meltan, that is, by opening a mystery box. You can get a Mystery Box that opens once a week by connecting your ‘Pokémon Go’ and ‘Pokémon Home’ accounts as described earlier.

The Mystery Box will act as an essence precisely for Meltan, attracting a large amount of the small Hex Nut Pokémon to your locality for one hour. It takes time to recharge, about three days, but after it is charged, you have to transfer another Pokémon to HOME to be able to use it again for an hour. If you get to use the Mystery Box in the course of specific events, you can even grab a Shiny Meltan.

Niantic’s games are designed to be played with others outdoors. This feature ends up giving players in some parts of the world advantage over others. This is specially to catch regional Pokemon and during ticketed events and sponsored events. Spoofers can avoid the barriers of distance and play anywhere in the world by iSpoofer for pogo installation and other such apps. Niantic, however, does not allow this and considers it the same as hacking. Players who were looking to play and access all the features of the game available all across the world.

iSpoofer has been shut down. All its applications, websites, and other related services have been terminated. iSpoofer for pogo installation does not exist. If any website claims to give access to the application or iSpoofer direct download, it is fake. Also, the new Pokemon Go application version which is 0.195.0 has been updated to detect applications like iSpoofer, so on being detected, it may lead to a warning, or a permanent ban as well. And we don’t see the certainty to get it back soon.
