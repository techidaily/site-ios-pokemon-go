## How to get the dragon scale and evolution-enabled pokemon On Apple iPhone 6s Plus?

The Dragon Scale is a special item in Pokémon Go that is used to evolve Seadra into Kingdra. To get a Dragon Scale in the game, you need to complete the 7-day Research Breakthrough. This means that you need to complete a Field Research task every day for 7 days to get the Dragon Scale. Once you have the Dragon Scale, you can use it to evolve Seadra into Kingdra.

Dragon scales in Pokémon GO are extremely exceptional and are utterly crucial in evolving pokemon. Pokemon go dragon scale evolutions can be as easy as utilizing the necessary amount of candy, but frequently scarce evolutions will call for an evolution object. These are usable that not only let you fill in your Pokedex but also gain access to many impactful beasts. There are several different ways to get a Dragon Scale, but none of them is guaranteed. This implies that you will have to accomplish as many of these tasks that are feasible – peculiarly because you can make use of them only once. Perhaps the simplest way of gaining a Dragon Scale is spinning Pokestops wherever likely. Each Pokestop comes up with a 1% probability of an evolution object, encompassing a Dragon Scale.

Following are the additional evolution items observed in Pokémon Go:

- King's Rock
- Metal Coat
- Sinnoh Stone
- Sun Stone
- Unova Stone
- Upgrade

## Part 1：What Pokémon can I evolve with a dragon scale on Pokémon Go?

The pokemon go dragon scale is one of the new evolution objects that can be employed in association with Pokemon Candy to evolve some of the generation 1 Pokemon to new generation 2 evolutions. The dragon scale is extremely strong and rigid. We can only make use of our Dragon Scale on a specific Pokemon. Dragon scale pokemon go evolutions contain the alteration of Seadra into Kingdra by combining the dragon scale along with 100 Horsea candies - making Kingdra a sturdy pocket monster ideal for raids and taking charge over the gyms.

![seadra evolving to kingdra](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/seadra-evolving-to-kingdra.jpg)

Once receiving a Dragon Scale, a player can only use it to evolve Seadra. Any other Pokemon will not evolve with it or even need it to evolve.

## Part 2：Fast way to get the exclusive Pokémon?

You can make use of the artificial locality of [Dr. Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to imitate your position without any motion and acquire exclusive Pokémon. The duplicate point of Dr. Fone lets you phony your orientation and permits your mobile application to presume that you are chosen in the app interface of Dr. Fone without being banned from the game or getting detected by the developers of Pokemon Go. To seize the pokemon, you can trail the instructions below with one click without having to go anywhere else.

**Step 1: Replicating Position Fluke:**

Pokemon Go can be played without requiring movement, using Dr. Fone's toolkit. To replicate the position and guarantee that the iOS gadget is associated with the application, open the Virtual Location property using a functioning lightning cable.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

You can click the ‘Get Started’ button to initiate the action as soon as your phone gets detected.

![virtual location 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 2: Mirroring Motion amid steps:**

Unfold the top right area of the initial option before reaching Dr. Fone's GUI, which permits you to imitate maneuver amid the two spots. Pick the positioning pin and click on the ‘transfer here’ button in the search bar.

![virtual location 08](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

To begin the replication, you will be required to make a movement and traverse the 'March' button to reach it multiple times. By default, the action is set to one but can be outweighed by the user, and the plan will change correspondingly.

![virtual location 09](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

The change location will act as genuine for the Pokémon Go application, and it will presume that the player is moving in between the two points you chose on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the rate of motion can also be modified, making use of the gliding menu. By following these steps, you can use the fake motion of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without needing to understand it, and your app will not be banned.

![virtual location 10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png)

![virtual location 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 3: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:**

Dr. Fone's application also lets you fake your motion joining more than two positions. The attribute is called after the multi-stop path that can be highlighted from the GUI toolbox class situated at the top-right position, which allows you to release several accurate endpoints on the map, and your position will take action correspondingly as managed by the virtual position application of Dr. Fone.

To let the system duplicate flow by choosing the accurate choices, press the 'March' button. You will have to do the Pokémon Go walking trick at some point. Dr. Fone's virtual motion replicator application makes your life a lot easier and lets you do the job without having to worry about travel charges.

## Part 3: How to get the dragon scale on Pokémon Go?

Pokemon go dragon scale can be obtained by taking charge of Gyms and spinning, waiting for the Pokestops to give you free dragon scales, but the chances are extremely low. PokeStops are symbolized by little blue box images on the map and usually can be observed in places of recreation such as a train station, a landmark, or even a regional post office. When your avatar is near to entering a PokeStop, the blue box image changes into a disc shape. The next thing you need to do is tap the disc, and it will exhibit a picture of the landmark, which is a chance to get a few free products.

You can get your hands on a dragon scale by spinning a specific Pokestop seven days in a row to get the required streak bonus. This won't ensure you a dragon scale; however, it will give you the possibility of achieving other evolutionary objects such as the Sun Stone, Upgrade, Sinnoh Stone, Unova Stone, Metal Coat, and King's Rock.

## Part 1: Will the iSpoofer back on 2020?

iSpoofer has been shut down. All its applications, websites, and other related services have been terminated. iSpoofer for pogo installation does not exist. If any website claims to give access to the application or iSpoofer direct download, it is fake. Also, the new Pokemon Go application version which is 0.195.0 has been updated to detect applications like iSpoofer, so on being detected, it may lead to a warning, or a permanent ban as well. And we don’t see the certainty to get it back soon.

iSpoofer for pogo installation has the following disadvantages -

- Niantic can easily detect spoofing through this app and may lead to a ban.
- Movement simulations are hard and unnatural, making it more susceptible to a ban.

The first un-evolved version is the serpentine Dratini that looks like a snake and continues shedding its skin as it grows. When you get to level 30, Dratini evolves into Dragonair, and at level 55 it becomes Dragonite

### Dragonair

This is an evolution of Dratini, which has a long scaly serpent-like body. It still retails the blue body with a white underside. The white bump on the forehead now becomes a white horn. The budding wings on the side of the head have now grown into full wings. It also carries three crystal orbs, with one on the neck and the other two on the tail.

Dragonair has the ability to stretch its wings so it can fly. It has a huge amount of energy in the body and can discharge the energy through the crystals. The energy that it releases has the ability to change the weather wherever it is. Dragonair can be found in seas and lakes.

### Dragonite

This is a Pokémon character that truly resembles a dragon and is the second evolution of Dratini. It has a yellow thick body, and a couple of antennae that come out of its forehead. It has a striated underbelly. The body is quite large when compared to the small wings.

Dragonite can fly at very high speeds despite its bulky appearance. It is a kindhearted Pokémon, which is as intelligent as a human being. It has been found to have tendencies to save humans from disasters, such as saving those who have come from a capsized ship on the high seas. It lives near the sea and is extremely rare in the Pokémon world.

## Part 2: Where can I find the Dratini nest?

Dratini is a Pokémon that lives in the water. Since it loves lakes and seas, you can find it when you visit areas that are near water. For example, in the United States, the most famous nests for Dratini are found in North Eastern San Francisco, Pier 39 and Pier 15. You will always find Dratini at these sites and they are famous for people who want to farm Dratini.

You may also g West to Squirtle Nest where you can get a lot of Dratini.

Dratini has a 5% spawning chance every day, so if you have the time, you can spend it on these sites as you enjoy the watery view and wait for it to appear.

Dratini nests can also be found in other parts of the world, such as Tokyo, Japan; Sydney and New South Wales, Australia; Paris, France and others.

## Part 3: Are the Dratini nest and spawn spot in the same place?

This is quite a common question for those who are new to the Pokémon universe. Basically, Dratini nests and spawn points are the same for a period of two weeks. The nests then migrate leaving the spawn points to spawn different types of Pokémon.

If the Dratini nest migrates, it can still come back in the future. You should always keep an eye at the spawn point where you first encountered your first Dratini Nest; it may come back once more and you can continue farming Dratini.

Dratini nests will migrate on alternate Thursdays at midnight. The nest migrations are random, so make sure that you visit and hit them many times over the two weeks in order to get the most Dratini that you can.

## Part 4: How to increase the possibility of earning Pokémon Go Dratini?

As mentioned earlier, Dratini can be found in certain places around the world. If you live outside these regions, you cannot be able to get Dratini. The best way to go about getting Dratini in such cases is to virtually relocate your device. This means that you can take your device to Tokyo nest sites even if you live in Africa.

The best app to use for teleportation is [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

**Features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)**

- Instantly teleport to an area where a Dratini nest has been found and remotely collect as many as you can.
- Use the joystick feature to move around the map until you come across Dratini.
- The app allows you to seem to be walking, riding a bike, or in a vehicle, on the map. This simulates real-time travel data, which is important when playing Pokémon Go.
- Any app that relies on geo-location data can safely use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for teleportation.

**A step-by-step guide to spoof your location using Dr.Fone Virtual Location (iOS)**

On the official Dr.Fone page, download and install Dr.Fone on your computer or you can click the Download button below to download it directly. Launch it and then go to the Home screen and click on “Virtual Location”.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

After entering the virtual location module, connect your iOS device to your computer using an original USB cable.

Next, click on “Get Started”; you will now be able to start the spoofing process.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Looking at the map, you can now see the actual location of your device. If the coordinates are not the correct ones, go to the bottom of your computer screen and click on the “Current Virtual location” icon. This will instantly point to the current virtual location of your device.

![virtual location 03](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Now go to the top side of your computer screen and click on the third icon on the bar. This instantly puts you in “teleport” mode. Now enter the coordinates of the Dratini nest that you have located. Hit the “Go” button and your device will instantly be teleported to the coordinates you entered.

The image below shows an example of coordinates entered for Rome, Italy.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Once you have successfully teleported your device, you will be able to navigate to the area where the Dratini nest has been found. You can use the joystick feature for this. You should also click on “Move here” so your location is permanently moved to that place.

You may now camp and keep hitting the Dratini nest so you can farm as many as possible within the two weeks before the nest migrates to another location.

Camping and looking for other Pokémon in the area will help you cool down and therefore avoid being banned from the game for spoofing your iOS device.

This is how your location will be viewed on the map.

## In conclusion

Dratini is one of the most friendly but rare Pokémon to get. It can evolve from a small serpentine worm, into a might, good-hearted dragon. This is one of the Pokémon that people love to farm for trading and taking part in raids and such events.

When you need to, you can teleport your device to an area where Dratini is popular using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) (iOS). Use the Dratini nest maps to find Dratini, and then visit the area or teleport there.
