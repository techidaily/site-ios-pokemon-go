## How to get the dragon scale and evolution-enabled pokemon On Apple iPhone 12 mini?

The Dragon Scale is a special item in Pokémon Go that is used to evolve Seadra into Kingdra. To get a Dragon Scale in the game, you need to complete the 7-day Research Breakthrough. This means that you need to complete a Field Research task every day for 7 days to get the Dragon Scale. Once you have the Dragon Scale, you can use it to evolve Seadra into Kingdra.

Dragon scales in Pokémon GO are extremely exceptional and are utterly crucial in evolving pokemon. Pokemon go dragon scale evolutions can be as easy as utilizing the necessary amount of candy, but frequently scarce evolutions will call for an evolution object. These are usable that not only let you fill in your Pokedex but also gain access to many impactful beasts. There are several different ways to get a Dragon Scale, but none of them is guaranteed. This implies that you will have to accomplish as many of these tasks that are feasible – peculiarly because you can make use of them only once. Perhaps the simplest way of gaining a Dragon Scale is spinning Pokestops wherever likely. Each Pokestop comes up with a 1% probability of an evolution object, encompassing a Dragon Scale.

Following are the additional evolution items observed in Pokémon Go:

- King's Rock
- Metal Coat
- Sinnoh Stone
- Sun Stone

## Part 3: How to get the dragon scale on Pokémon Go?

Pokemon go dragon scale can be obtained by taking charge of Gyms and spinning, waiting for the Pokestops to give you free dragon scales, but the chances are extremely low. PokeStops are symbolized by little blue box images on the map and usually can be observed in places of recreation such as a train station, a landmark, or even a regional post office. When your avatar is near to entering a PokeStop, the blue box image changes into a disc shape.

If you own an iOS device and are facing the Pokemon Go GPS bug, then you can follow these troubleshooting tips.

### Fix 1: Enable the Location Services on your Phone

Before taking any drastic measures, make sure that the location services on your iOS device are enabled. You can just go to the Control Center and tap on the GPS icon to turn it on. Alternatively, you can also browse to its Settings > Privacy > Location Services and toggle on this feature.

## The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Try On Apple iPhone 12 mini

_**“Is iSpoofer for Pokemon Go not working anymore? Can someone tell me how to spoof my iPhone X location now when the iSpoofer tool is shut down?”**_

If you have been using iSpoofer for a while to change your Apple iPhone 12 mini location, you can encounter a similar situation. Since iSpoofer is no longer available, users are actively looking for its alternative. In this post, I will let you know the iSpoofer use and why we can’t take its assistance to change the Pokemon Go location anymore. I will also make you familiar with the best iSpoofer alternative for iPhone and Android.

![ispoofer shutdown banner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-shutdown-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

Earlier, iSpoofer used to be one of the most popular apps to change our location on Pokemon Go. Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.

### Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

- The use of iSpoofer for Pokemon Go is against the terms of the game (as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party apps).
- Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.
- Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.
- Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.

![pokemon go account warning](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-go-account-warning.jpg)

### Will iSpoofer work again?

Most likely, the chances of iSpoofer working again are pretty bleak. This is because Pokemon Go users were the major target customers of the product. Since Niantic has blocklisted iSpoofer a while back, Pokemon Go players can no longer use it. Therefore, it is better to look for a reliable iSpoofer alternative instead.
