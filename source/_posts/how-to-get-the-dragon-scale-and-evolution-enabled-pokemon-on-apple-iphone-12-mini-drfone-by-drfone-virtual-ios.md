## How to get the dragon scale and evolution-enabled pokemon On Apple iPhone 12 mini?

The Dragon Scale is a special item in Pokémon Go that is used to evolve Seadra into Kingdra. To get a Dragon Scale in the game, you need to complete the 7-day Research Breakthrough. This means that you need to complete a Field Research task every day for 7 days to get the Dragon Scale. Once you have the Dragon Scale, you can use it to evolve Seadra into Kingdra.

Dragon scales in Pokémon GO are extremely exceptional and are utterly crucial in evolving pokemon. Pokemon go dragon scale evolutions can be as easy as utilizing the necessary amount of candy, but frequently scarce evolutions will call for an evolution object. These are usable that not only let you fill in your Pokedex but also gain access to many impactful beasts. There are several different ways to get a Dragon Scale, but none of them is guaranteed. This implies that you will have to accomplish as many of these tasks that are feasible – peculiarly because you can make use of them only once. Perhaps the simplest way of gaining a Dragon Scale is spinning Pokestops wherever likely. Each Pokestop comes up with a 1% probability of an evolution object, encompassing a Dragon Scale.

Following are the additional evolution items observed in Pokémon Go:

- King's Rock
- Metal Coat
- Sinnoh Stone
- Sun Stone
- Unova Stone
- Upgrade

## Part 1：What Pokémon can I evolve with a dragon scale on Pokémon Go?

The pokemon go dragon scale is one of the new evolution objects that can be employed in association with Pokemon Candy to evolve some of the generation 1 Pokemon to new generation 2 evolutions. The dragon scale is extremely strong and rigid. We can only make use of our Dragon Scale on a specific Pokemon. Dragon scale pokemon go evolutions contain the alteration of Seadra into Kingdra by combining the dragon scale along with 100 Horsea candies - making Kingdra a sturdy pocket monster ideal for raids and taking charge over the gyms.

![seadra evolving to kingdra](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/seadra-evolving-to-kingdra.jpg)

Once receiving a Dragon Scale, a player can only use it to evolve Seadra. Any other Pokemon will not evolve with it or even need it to evolve.

## Part 2：Fast way to get the exclusive Pokémon?

You can make use of the artificial locality of [Dr. Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to imitate your position without any motion and acquire exclusive Pokémon. The duplicate point of Dr. Fone lets you phony your orientation and permits your mobile application to presume that you are chosen in the app interface of Dr. Fone without being banned from the game or getting detected by the developers of Pokemon Go. To seize the pokemon, you can trail the instructions below with one click without having to go anywhere else.

**Step 1: Replicating Position Fluke:**

Pokemon Go can be played without requiring movement, using Dr. Fone's toolkit. To replicate the position and guarantee that the iOS gadget is associated with the application, open the Virtual Location property using a functioning lightning cable.

![virtual location 08](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

To begin the replication, you will be required to make a movement and traverse the 'March' button to reach it multiple times. By default, the action is set to one but can be outweighed by the user, and the plan will change correspondingly.

![virtual location 09](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

The change location will act as genuine for the Pokémon Go application, and it will presume that the player is moving in between the two points you chose on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the rate of motion can also be modified, making use of the gliding menu. By following these steps, you can use the fake motion of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without needing to understand it, and your app will not be banned.

![virtual location 10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png)

![virtual location 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 3: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:**

Dr. Fone's application also lets you fake your motion joining more than two positions. The attribute is called after the multi-stop path that can be highlighted from the GUI toolbox class situated at the top-right position, which allows you to release several accurate endpoints on the map, and your position will take action correspondingly as managed by the virtual position application of Dr. Fone.

To let the system duplicate flow by choosing the accurate choices, press the 'March' button. You will have to do the Pokémon Go walking trick at some point. Dr. Fone's virtual motion replicator application makes your life a lot easier and lets you do the job without having to worry about travel charges.

## Part 3: How to get the dragon scale on Pokémon Go?

Pokemon go dragon scale can be obtained by taking charge of Gyms and spinning, waiting for the Pokestops to give you free dragon scales, but the chances are extremely low. PokeStops are symbolized by little blue box images on the map and usually can be observed in places of recreation such as a train station, a landmark, or even a regional post office. When your avatar is near to entering a PokeStop, the blue box image changes into a disc shape. The next thing you need to do is tap the disc, and it will exhibit a picture of the landmark, which is a chance to get a few free products.

You can get your hands on a dragon scale by spinning a specific Pokestop seven days in a row to get the required streak bonus. This won't ensure you a dragon scale; however, it will give you the possibility of achieving other evolutionary objects such as the Sun Stone, Upgrade, Sinnoh Stone, Unova Stone, Metal Coat, and King's Rock.

## Conclusion

Specific Pokémon in Pokémon GO now call for rare evolution items such as a steel coat, a sunstone, a king's rock, a dragon scale, or an upgrade to evolve, all of which are unplanned drops from Pokestops. However, the players can make use of [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) application to gain version exclusive Pokemon and evolution items and make advancements in the game.

## Pokemon Go No GPS Signal? Here's Every Possible Solution On Apple iPhone 12 mini

_**“Every time I open Pokemon Go, I get the no GPS signal error. Can someone tell me how to fix these Pokemon Go GPS issues?”**_

This is one of the many queries that we have got lately about the Pokemon Go GPS problem. You would already know that without a stable GPS signal, you won’t be able to catch Pokemons or access other features of the game. Thankfully, there are several ways to fix these Pokemon Go GPS issues on Android and iOS devices. In this post, I will let you know about numerous methods to fix GPS on Pokemon Go.

![pokemon go no gps signal banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/pokemon-go-no-gps-signal-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Common Reasons for Pokemon Go GPS Problems

Ideally, the Pokemon Go no GPS signal could be caused by either of these reasons:

- Chances are that the GPS feature on your device might not be functioning.
- Your phone might not be connected to an active internet connection.
- Pokemon Go could not have permission to access the location of your device.
- Your phone or the Pokemon Go app might not be loaded or started correctly.
- It could also happen if you are running an old or outdated version of Pokemon Go.
- There could be any other app or firmware-related issue causing this problem.

![pokemon gps signal not found](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/pokemon-gps-signal-not-found.jpg)

## Part 2: How to Fix Pokemon Go No GPS Signal Issue on iOS Devices?

If you own an iOS device and are facing the Pokemon Go GPS bug, then you can follow these troubleshooting tips.

### Fix 1: Enable the Location Services on your Phone

Before taking any drastic measures, make sure that the location services on your iOS device are enabled. You can just go to the Control Center and tap on the GPS icon to turn it on. Alternatively, you can also browse to its Settings > Privacy > Location Services and toggle on this feature.

![enable location services iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/enable-location-services-iphone.jpg)

After that, you can restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS Pokemon Go issue or not.

### Fix 2: Grant the Pokemon Go app Location Access

Turning on the location services on your Apple iPhone 12 mini is not enough and you need to grant the GPS access to the Pokemon Go app. To fix the Pokemon Go GPS problem on your Apple iPhone 12 mini, simply visit its Settings > Privacy > Location Services. Now, from the list of the installed apps, select Pokemon Go and make sure it can access the GPS on your Apple iPhone 12 mini while running (or always).

![pokemon go location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/pokemon-go-location-services.jpg)

### Fix 3: Set Precise Location for Pokemon Go

In case the Pokemon Go GPS is not accurate on your Apple iPhone 12 mini, then you can enable the “Precise Location” option for the app. This will make sure that Pokemon Go can access the exact location of your phone.

To fix these Pokemon Go GPS issues, you can go to your phone’s Settings > Privacy > Location Services and select Pokemon Go. From the location sharing option, make sure the Precise Location feature is enabled.

![iphone precise location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/iphone-precise-location.jpg)

### Fix 4: Step Into an Open Area

If you're currently in an area with poor GPS reception due to buildings or trees, try moving to an open area with a clear view of the sky. This can significantly improve your GPS signal strength.

### Fix 5: Restart the App and the Apple iPhone 12 mini device

Lastly, you can just reload the Pokemon Go app or restart your Apple iPhone 12 mini if you still get the Pokemon Go no GPS signal. You can just go to the app drawer and swipe up the Pokemon Go card to close the app.

![close pokemon go app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/close-pokemon-go-app.jpg)

You can also press the Power or the Side + Volume Up/Down keys (for newer models) to get the power option. Swipe it to turn off your device and press the Power/Side key afterward to restart your phone.

## Part 3: How to Fix the Pokemon Go No GPS Signal Issues on Android?

Just like iPhone models, fixing the Pokemon Go GPS problem on Android phones is pretty easy and can be done in the following way:

### Fix 1: Check the Location Services on your phone

Needless to say, the first thing that you should do is to check the location settings on your phone to fix the GPS Pokemon Go problem.

You can just slide down the Control Center and tap on the GPS button to enable the location services. Besides that, you can also go to your phone’s Settings > Locations and turn it on.

![android location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/android-location-services.jpg)

### Fix 2: Grant Location access to Pokemon Go

If you have not granted the location services permission to Pokemon Go, then you can get the no GPS signal error on it. To fix the Pokemon Go GPS issues, you can go to its Settings > Location > App-based Permissions and enable the GPS access for Pokemon Go.

![pokemon go location access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/pokemon-go-location-access.jpg)

### Fix 3: Reinstall the Pokemon Go App

As listed above, one of the reasons for this Pokemon Go GPS bug could be a corrupt or outdated app. The easiest way to fix this is by uninstalling Pokemon Go on your phone. Afterward, restart your phone and go to Play Store to install Pokemon Go on your Android again.

![pokemon go update](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/pokemon-go-update.jpg)

### Fix 4: Set GPS on High Accuracy

![android location mode accuracy](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/android-location-mode-accuracy.jpg)

## The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Try On Apple iPhone 12 mini

_**“Is iSpoofer for Pokemon Go not working anymore? Can someone tell me how to spoof my iPhone X location now when the iSpoofer tool is shut down?”**_

If you have been using iSpoofer for a while to change your Apple iPhone 12 mini location, you can encounter a similar situation. Since iSpoofer is no longer available, users are actively looking for its alternative. In this post, I will let you know the iSpoofer use and why we can’t take its assistance to change the Pokemon Go location anymore. I will also make you familiar with the best iSpoofer alternative for iPhone and Android.

![ispoofer shutdown banner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-shutdown-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

Earlier, iSpoofer used to be one of the most popular apps to change our location on Pokemon Go. Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.

### Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

- The use of iSpoofer for Pokemon Go is against the terms of the game (as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party apps).
- Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.
- Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.
- Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.

![pokemon go account warning](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-go-account-warning.jpg)

### Will iSpoofer work again?

Most likely, the chances of iSpoofer working again are pretty bleak. This is because Pokemon Go users were the major target customers of the product. Since Niantic has blocklisted iSpoofer a while back, Pokemon Go players can no longer use it. Therefore, it is better to look for a reliable iSpoofer alternative instead.

![ispoofer not working](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-not-working.jpg)

## Part 2: The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Change your Apple iPhone 12 mini Location

## Part 3: How to Spoof your Android Device’s Location for Pokemon Go?

Unlike iOS devices, it is pretty easy to spoof location in Android devices. This is because Google allows us to mock the location of our device using any reliable mobile app (unlike Apple). Therefore, if you are looking for an iSpoofer alternative for Android devices, you can follow these basic instructions.

**Step 1: Enable the Mock Location feature**

At first, you need to turn on the Developer Options to enable the Mock Location feature. For this, go to your phone’s Settings > About Phone and tap the “Build Number” seven times to turn on Developer Options.

![enable developer options](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/enable-developer-options.jpg)

Great! Now you can go to your phone’s Settings > Developer Options and turn on the Mock Location option.

![allow mock locations](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/allow-mock-locations.jpg)

**Step 2: Install a Mock Location App**

Afterward, you can go to the Play Store and install any reliable mock location app from developers like Hola or Lexa. Let’s suppose we have installed the Mock GPS app by Lexa on the Apple iPhone 12 mini device.

![fake gps lexa](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-gps-lexa.jpg)

Once the app has been downloaded, you can again go to your phone’s Settings > Developer Options and set the app as a default tool to spoof your location.

![select mock location app](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-mock-location-app.jpg)

**Step 3: Change your device’s location**

That’s it! Now you can launch the mock location app and enter the address or coordinates of any target location. You can further adjust the pin and drop it anywhere you like to spoof the Apple iPhone 12 mini device’s location.

![fake location on lexa](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-location-on-lexa.jpg)

There you go! After reading this post, I’m sure that you would be able to know about the iSpoofer use for Pokemon Go. Since iSpoofer has been shut down, you can no longer use it to change your Apple iPhone 12 mini location. Therefore, you can consider [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) (iOS & Android) as an ideal iSpoofer alternative for your device. In just a few clicks, you can change the location of your Apple iPhone 12 mini anywhere you like and that too without jailbreaking your phone.
