For example, if you want to catch the special characters or characters of another city, you have to that place. This is the only drawback for players. However, with location spoofing apps, you can catch characters from any location without actually moving there.

But, spoofing Pokémon Go is not easy, as Niantic keeps a close watch to spoofers. To spoof the Pogo, you will need trusted and safe spoofing apps like PGSharp for android and Dr.Fone virtual location for iOS.

Let’s find out how PGSharp and Dr.Fone virtual location app save you from getting banned while spoofing Pokémon Go.

## Part 1: Ninatic Policies against Spoofing

Getting banned for cheating Pokémon is nothing new. Niantic always modifies the policies to catch the spoofers and to maintain the originality of the game. Niantic has made a proper discipline policy with three strikes to punish the spoofers.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-3.jpg)

**Firstly, punishment:** On the first fake strike, you will get a warning message, but you still can play the game. But, while plying, you will not be able to anything remotely for about seven days.

**Secondly, Punishment:** On the second fake strike, Niantic may close your account temporarily for a month. It also gives you a warning message for future misuse of the game.

**Thirdly, Punishment:** On the third strike, Niantic will ban the account for more than a month.

However, if you get caught regularly, the developer of Pokémon Go has the authority to permanently ban your account.

### Does it mean you can never spoof Pokémon Go?

No, you can spoof Pokémon Go with the best spoofing tools like PGSHarp and Dr.Fone virtual location.

**Why PGSharp?**

- Finally, do not root your Phone, be it Android or iPhone. It is because when you root your device, its security gets compromised, and it is easy to get data about your device’s fake location. And, your Pokémon Go account also can be at risk.

## Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?

All Pokemon Go game variations have Rare Candy, and they are mainly used to upgrade the level of any Pokemon by 1. If you were at level 9, you automatically go up to level 10, etc. This will save you from having to engage in battles to raise your level. You may also earn the level attacks that you would have earned at that level, even without having to fight.

There are a limited number of Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red. However, you can get unlimited Rare Candies by using Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candy cheat codes through GameShark or Action Replay. You may also get them through cloning your existing Rare Cady.

When you use a Rare Candy, you get enough Exp. Points to move to the next level. This means that it is best to use them for getting to the next level, especially when it becomes too challenging. Although you get to the next level, you will not earn any Effort Value Points, which will make your Pokemon weaker than it would have been if you had leveled up through training.

#### Instructions for Getting Pokémon GO Fire Red Rare Candy Without Walking/Moving

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location offers a simple and easy-to-understand way to spoof your location when playing Pokémon GO. The following are the steps you need to follow for location spoofing:

**Step 1: Connect to Dr.Fone - Virtual Location and Set Target Location**

With Dr.Fone - Virtual Location launched on your computer, connect your smartphone. Once on the map screen, click the "Teleport Mode" icon, the first one, from the toolbar near the top-right corner. Now tap the search bar on the top left corner, enter the targeted location, and press "Enter."

![search for the required location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 2: Teleport to Targeted Location**

The cursor on the map screen will move to the location you have entered on the map. If you want to move there when spoofing your location, click "Move Here." It will change the location on the map screen and on your device to the location you entered. You can confirm it by accessing your smartphone and opening a map application.

**Step 3: Simulate Movement and Configure Route**

To simulate movement when spoofing your location, you can select either “One-Stop Route” or “Multi-Stop Route.” Both are the third and fourth options, respectively, on the toolbar near the top right corner. Now, choose the stop points, type of trip, walking speed, and other parameters. Once you are done, tap "Move Here" or "Start Moving" to initiate the movement.
