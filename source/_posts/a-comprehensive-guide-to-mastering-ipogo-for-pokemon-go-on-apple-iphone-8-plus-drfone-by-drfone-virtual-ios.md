**Price**: The basic version of iPogo is available for free that would let you teleport your location in Pokemon Go. To access more features of iPogo for Pokemon Go, you can get its premium subscription for $4.99 per month.

## Part 2: How to Use iPogo to Improve your Pokemon Go Gameplay?

If you also want to use the iPogo iOS app, then you first need to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 8 Plus. Also, since the use of iPogo for Pokemon Go can lead to an account ban, you can consider creating a new account before using it. Here’s how you can use the iPogo iOS app to spoof location on Pokemon Go.

**Step 1: Download and Install the iPogo iOS app**

At first, you can just jailbreak your device by using any freely available resource that would install Cydia Impactor on it. Later, you can go to the website of iPogo to download the IPA file and complete its installation. You can also use third-party sources like 3uTools, Rickpactor, or Signulous to install iPogo on your iOS device.

## Part 3: Why you Should Look for iPogo Alternatives?

Even though iPogo would let you access all kinds of Pokemon Go hacks, it has numerous pitfalls. Here are some of the reasons that would make you look for a better iPogo alternative instead.

- Firstly, the iPogo iOS app would need [jailbreak access on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/how-to-jailbreak-ios-on-windows.html) which can compromise its security.
- As of now, iPogo is only available for iOS devices and not Android. If you are looking for an iPogo Android alternative, then you can try [PGSharp](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-effective-pgsharp-spoof-pokemon-go.html) as well.
- Ideally, iPogo for Pokemon Go is against the terms and conditions of Niantic and its constant use can cause a permanent ban on your account.
- Since the installation process for the iPogo iOS app is a bit complicated, it would need prior technical experience.
- Please note that iPogo is not a reliable service and it can stop working anytime (like [iSpoofer](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-shut-down.html)). This can cause a sudden loss of your money and progress in Pokemon Go.

## Part 4: How to Spoof iPhone Location without Jailbreak Using the Best iPogo Alternative?

Since iPogo needs jailbreak access and is not that reliable, a lot of players look for its alternative. For instance, you can use [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to easily spoof the location on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus without jailbreaking it. The application is super easy to use and also provides a GPS joystick to stimulate your movement between multiple spots.
