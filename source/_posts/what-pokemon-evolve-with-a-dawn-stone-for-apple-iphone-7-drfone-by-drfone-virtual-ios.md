## What Pokémon Evolve with A Dawn Stone For Apple iPhone 7?

If you are a diehard Pokémon Go player, you probably know how exciting it is when your Pokémon evolves. Evolutions mean a boost in stats and strength in raids. Plenty of Pokémon users are conversant with the traditional raiding as a way to evolve. However, you can use special items to evolve your Pokémon. One such item is the dawn stone. In this article, we are going to take you through a detailed guide on dawn stone evolutions and how to get it with ease.

## Part 1. Dawn Stone Pokémon Evolutions

### What is Dawn Stone in Pokémon Sword and Shield?

Like Shiny Stone, dusk stone, Sun Stone, and Moon Stone, Dawn Stone is another peculiar evolution item in Pokémon Sword and Shield. If you combine Dawn Stone with certain Pokémon, they will evolve to another level. This peculiar stone was introduced in Generation IV, and in terms of appearance, Dawn Stone sparkles like a glittering eye.

![dawn stone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/dawn-stone.jpg)

You can get dawn stone from the Digging Duo found near the Wild Area nursery. You will, however, be required to pay them 500 watts before digging random items for you. Remember, this is a trial and error thing, and you might have to spend a lot of watts before finding a dawn stone. Also, you can get any evolutionary stone, including the Dawn Stone in the Lake of Outrage. Here, you will have to first obtain a Rotom Bike on route 9 to move across the water.

### Pokémon that Evolve with Dawn Stone

As aforementioned, dawn stone is an evolution item that is used to evolve certain species of Pokémon. To evolve your Pokémon using Dawn Stone in Pokémon Sword and Shield, enter the bag menu and choose the "Other Items" tab. Hover on the Dawn Stone and select the "Use this item" option. Finally, select the Pokémon to evolve. These Pokémon that can be evolved using dawn stone include:

### 1\. Kirlia

Kirlia is a small humanoid Pokémon whose upper body and arms are white while the waist and legs are light green. This makes it appear as though it is wearing tights. Kirlia's natural abilities include synchronization and trace. It loves dancing on sunny mornings and becomes more beautiful when they sense e positive emotions of trainers. A vast majority of Kirlia live in the cities, although some are still found in the forest. Kirlia evolved from Ralts and has two possible evolutions, namely Gardevoir and Gallade. If it reaches level 30, it evolves to Gardevoir. However, if it is male and given a dawn stone, it will evolve to Gallade.

### 2\. Snorunt

Snorunt is an ice-type Pokémon that was introduced in Generation III. It is also referred to as the "Snow Hat Pokémon." You can find Snorunt in seafoam café, snow canyon, or even in Mysterious Grotto. Furthermore, you can obtain it by trading or Pokémon Roulette. Snorunt can evolve into Glalie or Froslass. If it reaches level 42, Snorunt evolves to Glalie. For Snorunt to evolve into Froslass, it requires a dawn stone. However, the Snorunt must be a female to evolve to Froslass.

## Part 2. Hacks and Tricks to get Dawn Stone Pokémon

It is every player's wish to avoid the long hunt for a Dawn Stone into their Podex. This issue has given birth to some of the hacks and tricks to help players cross territory and find the intended evolution item or Pokémon. Some of these tricks include:

### 1\. Use iOS spoofing tool- Dr. Fone Virtual Location

## Full Guide to Catch 100 IV Pokémon Using a Map On Apple iPhone 7

**_“How do I find 100 IV Pokémon in Pokémon Go? I have heard of some techniques, but can’t find any reliable Pokémon Go 100 IV map that works!”_**

 As I read this query posted by a Pokémon Go player on Reddit, I realized that a lot of people can encounter this issue. Since getting a 100 IV Pokémon is something that every player wants, I decided to come up with this guide. In this post, I will share some smart tricks that would help you catch a 100 IV Pokémon.

_**Tips:** Are you finding the 100 IV Pokémon Go map? Discover the ultimate solution with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, your key to pinpointing and capturing those coveted 100 IV Pokémon! Try it now and unlock endless possibilities!_

## Part 1: What Does 100 IV Mean in Pokémon Go?

IV stands for Individual Value, which depicts the overall performance of any Pokémon in the game. You can say that it is a kind of rank of Pokémon in the game. Ideally, not all Pokémon of the same species have the exact efficiencies. Any Pokémon in the game is measured by three tactics – attack, defense, and stamina. A value from 0 to 15 is allocated for all these parameters. A Pokémon with 15/15/15 perfect stats would get a 100 Individual Value.

- A Pokémon with 45/45 stats is known as a 100 IV Pokémon, as it can reach the maximum CP for its species.
- These Pokémon have a higher HP, base stats, and combat value, and just perform better than other Pokémon of lower IV.

Now, as you know what 100 IV means, we are sure that you want to catch the Pokémon with 100 IV on the map. But, for catching Pokémon 100 IV, you either need patience or wait for days, or you can do it with spoofing.

Yes, you read it right! With [Pokemon Go spoofing](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html), you can catch powerful characters in less time.

![Pokemon Go 100 IV Map introduction](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-1.jpg)

In the following parts, we will discuss in detail the possible ways to catch Pokémon Go IV 100 on the map, including location spoofer.

Keeping reading!

## Part 2: How to Check the IVs of Pokémon?

Before you put effort into catching the Pokémon IV 100 map, you should have knowledge about which Pokémon has a stat of 100 IV. Following are the ways with which you can check the IVs of Pokémon in the Pokémon Go game.

### 2.1 Check IVs within the app

You can check the true percentages of your characters’ IVs in the gaming app itself. Now, if you use the appraisal system of the app, your team leader will show the stats of each Pokémon and can give it a star rating as well.

Further, you can also click on the arrows on the left and right to see the stats of the next Pokémon.

### 2.2 Know Pokémon IV using search filters

![know pokemon iv](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-2.jpg)

Pokémon Go app has a search feature that you can use to know the exact IV of Pokémon. To do this, tap the search icon present at the top of your Pokémon menu. Now in the search bar, type the name of any Pokémon, say type “shiny”. This will show all the shiny mons with different star ratings.

Now check the Pokémon by their star rating, as this is the easy way to know about the IVs of characters. Type “4\*” in the search bar, and you will see characters with a 4-star rating. Mostly a star Pokémon are a 100 IV Pokémon map.

## Part 3: Tips to Catch 100 IV Pokémon in the Game

Since 100 IV Pokémon are so sought-after, catching them can be a tough job. Apart from using a **Pokémon Go 100 IV map**, here are other tips that can increase your chances to catch the perfect IVs Pokémon to some extent. A Weather Boosted wild catch can increase your odds to a 1 in 1,725 chance. But, this is still not so easy for a player.

![catch 100 iv pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-3.jpg)

- If you are fortunate, then you can end up [catching a “lucky” Pokémon](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html). Though, the chances of a lucky Pokémon having 100 IV are 1 in 64 presently.
- Although you get only one chance in 4,096 chances to catch the high-rank character in Pokemon Go and the probability of finding perfect IVs is 0.0244% from a wild catch, you can do some research to improve your chances.
- Catching a Pokémon from a quest, hatching it from an egg, or catching it by defending a raid might also result in a 100 IV Pokémon (1 in 216 chances).
- Trading increases the chances of perfect IVs.

Trading is one way to improve the chances of catching the 100 IV Pokémon Go map. Trading Pokémon between friends can increase the odds of finding perfect IVs. Moreover, it is a great way to boost IVs, as well. The odds depend on your level of friendship.

![trading increases the chance of perfect ivs](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-4.jpg)

- For example, with good friend trade, the chances are 1 in 3,375
- With great friend trade, the chances are 1 in 2,744
- When you make a trade with ultra-friend, the chances are 1 in 2,197
- Last, doing trade with a best friend creates chances to catch perfect IV 1 in 1,331

But, again, trading Pokémon is not very helpful. If you only rely on trading, you may have to wait for a long time for perfect IVs.

## How Can I Catch the Regional Pokémon without Traveling On Apple iPhone 7

The main goal that the designers of Pokémon Go had in mind for the past few years was to create a framework that prompts players to get off their loungers and go into the real world in search of Pokémon. If you are wondering why there are certain types of Pokémon enlisted as ‘blanks’ in your Pokedex and you haven’t yet found them, it’s probably because they are marked as ‘regional’ types. This means that these Pokémon are exclusively locked in select regions around the world. Don’t Panic! You don’t have to spend a boat load of cash in order to catch these special regional Pokémon as there are tricks you can apply to catch them without even stepping out of your kitchen.

## Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced

Since the game publishers released these special regional Pokémon, they have been locked in their geo-specific locations around the world. There is a set or pair of regional Pokémon for each generation that has been introduced into the game. Regions may not be defined by real-time borders but are divided according to the type of the Pokémon and the place they are more likely to spawn.

These places may be specific to countries (Tauros spawn in the US), specific to a continent (Mr.Mime Spawn in Europe), specific to a region (Corsola spawn in the Tropics), and even certain halves of the planet (Lunastone and Solrock spawn in the Southern half and Northern half of the equator, respectively). These Pokémon are not necessarily rare spawn types. If you are traveling in their region, they may pop up quite frequently. You should take note that regional Pokémon won’t become available in Gyms or in Nests since they will only spawn in the wild. However, you can yet find them through eggs but only in their specific regions.

There are some exceptions among the regionals as well. These exceptions are known to swap their spawn locations or drop out of regional exclusivities like Zangoose and Seviper, or Minun and Plusle. Some regional Pokémon may also turn up in special in-game events like how Farfetch’d spawned during the 2017 Pokémon Go Travel Challenge.

If you are not a frequent traveler or know fellow trainers who are willing to trade their regional Pokémon then you may need to be patient and follow a few extra steps in order to get your hands on these rare types of Pokémon.

List of different Regional Pokémon – Where and How to Catch them All!

As of now, there are over 40 different regional Pokémon divided across generations that can be captured or hatched only in specific expanses of the world. There are of course occasional overlaps of Pokémon slipping out of their region and into other sectors. Let’s get into the list of all the region-specific Pokémon of different generations and where to find them.

## Part 2: How to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to catch Regional Pokémon

Catching regionally exclusive Pokémon requires you to travel to that location or region where the Pokémon is located, as it was originally intended by the game. Remember that Pokémon Go functions by tracking your location via GPS. Your GPS however, is a virtual means of tracking your IP address which can be faked using the right mock GPS and VPN. You can use a mock virtual location to fake your actual location and make it seem like you’re traveling around the world. The game itself would be tricked, allowing you to travel to regions and get your hands on those geo-exclusive Pokémon.

To get the best out of your mock location and also to avoid the risk of hitting a light ban on your account, [Dr.Fone Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) by Wondershare has been reviewed as a Mock GPS you can easily rely on. It offers a number of features that can come in handy while faking your location such as adjusting the speed so that it may seem like you’re actually traveling, you can use a 360-degree virtual joystick for manual control over your movements and you can also select specific routes on the map on which you want your in-game avatar to move on.

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

You can follow these easy steps to set up and access your Dr.Fone Virtual Location in an instant and teleport to anywhere in the world.

**Step 1: Download the Program**

Download Dr.Fone – Virtual Location. Install and launch the program. Click ‘Virtual Location’ to get access to the options window.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

![virtual location 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3: Check the Location**

When the location map opens, click on ‘Centre On’ to accurately pinpoint the GPS to your location.

![virtual location 03](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

**Step 4: Activate teleport mode**

Now, click on the icon given in the upper right-hand corner. Enter your desired location on the upper right field and then click ‘Go’.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 5: Start Teleporting**

Once the location of your choice pops up, click ‘Move here’ in the pop-up box.

![virtual location 05](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

Once the location has been changed, you can center your GPS or move the location on your device, it will still be set to the location you have selected.



## Part 3: Tips to help catch Regional Pokémon

Catching regional Pokémon is just like catching any regular Pokémon. When they spawn near your location, you catch it by throwing a Poke ball at it. If the Poke ball is seen shaking, it means that the Pokémon is resisting and may just pop out from the ball in which case you may have to throw another one at it. Now, if you are traveling and you have limited time or a number of spawns then here are a few tips you can utilize to enhance your chances of landing a catch.

- **Curve Ball:** Practice your curveball throws. Throwing a curve ball automatically increases your chances of preventing a Pokémon from slipping through your hands, plus you also get a 17x bonus with each successful curve catch.
- **Maximize your Medals:** Medals increase your performance in the game without costing you any extra resources like Great balls, Ultra Balls, or Razz Balls. So, try and max out your medals to increase your chances of catching rare Pokémon, especially the exclusive ones.
- **Keep Consistent:** The algorithm of the game is quite complex but eventually, a pattern emerges. You will notice that if you keep practicing with great or excellent catches with the smaller (low XP) Pokémon, it increases your chances of catching the ones that put up a fight.
- **Save your Berries:** Feeding a Pokémon with Razz Berries increases your assurances of catching the Pokémon while also giving you a 15x bonus when you land a successful catch. Save your berries for those persistent Pokémon spawns.
- **Use Powerful Poke balls:** Last but definitely not least, use powerful balls like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball to maximize your chances of catching Pokémon. You should also remember that these are diminishable resources so use them wisely. On catching a Pokémon with a Great ball you will get 15x and with an Ultra ball you would get 2x so utilize them accordingly to catch rare and super rare Pokémon.

## Conclusion

The journey to completing your Pokedex may not be a short one as there are hundreds of Pokémon out there, and even hundreds more yet to be introduced into the game. Traveling the world in search of the rarest regional Pokémon is meant to be a fun and exciting experience, yet it may not be viable for some who wish to enjoy the game to the fullest. Utilizing a fake GPS and VPN can bridge the gaps in your Pokedex and keep the game fun for you at the same time. So keep playing and catching Pokémon as there are loads of other exciting installments yet to be introduced by Niantic in the future.
