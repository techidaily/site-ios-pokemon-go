## The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Try On Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max

_**“Is iSpoofer for Pokemon Go not working anymore? Can someone tell me how to spoof my iPhone X location now when the iSpoofer tool is shut down?”**_

If you have been using iSpoofer for a while to change your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max location, you can encounter a similar situation. Since iSpoofer is no longer available, users are actively looking for its alternative. In this post, I will let you know the iSpoofer use and why we can’t take its assistance to change the Pokemon Go location anymore. I will also make you familiar with the best iSpoofer alternative for iPhone and Android.

![ispoofer shutdown banner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-shutdown-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

Earlier, iSpoofer used to be one of the most popular apps to change our location on Pokemon Go. Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.

### Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

- The use of iSpoofer for Pokemon Go is against the terms of the game (as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party apps).
- Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.
- Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.
- Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.

![pokemon go account warning](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-go-account-warning.jpg)

### Will iSpoofer work again?

Most likely, the chances of iSpoofer working again are pretty bleak. This is because Pokemon Go users were the major target customers of the product. Since Niantic has blocklisted iSpoofer a while back, Pokemon Go players can no longer use it. Therefore, it is better to look for a reliable iSpoofer alternative instead.

You can follow these simple steps to use this iSpoofer alternative to change your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max location easily.

**Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to the system**

To begin with, you can connect your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to the system and launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location on it. Now, agree to its terms and click on the “Get Started” button.

![virtual location 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 2: Enter the target location**

Once your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max is detected, the interface will display its present location. You can now click on the teleport mode icon from the top.

![virtual location 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Now, please enter the address or the coordinates of the target location and load it on the map.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max location**

As you would select the target location, the application will automatically change the interface. You can now drag the pin around and even zoom in/out the map to select the target location. Lastly, you can select the “Move Here” button and the location of your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max would be changed automatically.

![virtual location 5](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

You can now launch Pokemon Go or any other GPS-based app to check the spoofed location of your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max.

![virtual location 7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png)

**Note:** Keep in mind the cooldown duration before changing your location to ensure your account won’t get banned by Niantic while using the location spoofer. For instance, wait for a few minutes and only change your location realistically.



## Part 3: How to Spoof your Android Device’s Location for Pokemon Go?

Unlike iOS devices, it is pretty easy to spoof location in Android devices. This is because Google allows us to mock the location of our device using any reliable mobile app (unlike Apple). Therefore, if you are looking for an iSpoofer alternative for Android devices, you can follow these basic instructions.

**Step 1: Enable the Mock Location feature**

At first, you need to turn on the Developer Options to enable the Mock Location feature. For this, go to your phone’s Settings > About Phone and tap the “Build Number” seven times to turn on Developer Options.

![enable developer options](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/enable-developer-options.jpg)

Great! Now you can go to your phone’s Settings > Developer Options and turn on the Mock Location option.

![allow mock locations](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/allow-mock-locations.jpg)

**Step 2: Install a Mock Location App**

Afterward, you can go to the Play Store and install any reliable mock location app from developers like Hola or Lexa. Let’s suppose we have installed the Mock GPS app by Lexa on the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device.

![fake gps lexa](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-gps-lexa.jpg)

Once the app has been downloaded, you can again go to your phone’s Settings > Developer Options and set the app as a default tool to spoof your location.

![select mock location app](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-mock-location-app.jpg)

**Step 3: Change your device’s location**

That’s it! Now you can launch the mock location app and enter the address or coordinates of any target location. You can further adjust the pin and drop it anywhere you like to spoof the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device’s location.

![fake location on lexa](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-location-on-lexa.jpg)

There you go! After reading this post, I’m sure that you would be able to know about the iSpoofer use for Pokemon Go. Since iSpoofer has been shut down, you can no longer use it to change your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max location. Therefore, you can consider [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) (iOS & Android) as an ideal iSpoofer alternative for your device. In just a few clicks, you can change the location of your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max anywhere you like and that too without jailbreaking your phone.

- Your phone might not be connected to an active internet connection.
- Pokemon Go could not have permission to access the location of your device.
- Your phone or the Pokemon Go app might not be loaded or started correctly.
- It could also happen if you are running an old or outdated version of Pokemon Go.

## Part 2: How to Fix Pokemon Go No GPS Signal Issue on iOS Devices?

If you own an iOS device and are facing the Pokemon Go GPS bug, then you can follow these troubleshooting tips.

### Fix 1: Enable the Location Services on your Phone

Before taking any drastic measures, make sure that the location services on your iOS device are enabled. You can just go to the Control Center and tap on the GPS icon to turn it on. Alternatively, you can also browse to its Settings > Privacy > Location Services and toggle on this feature.

![enable location services iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/enable-location-services-iphone.jpg)

After that, you can restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS Pokemon Go issue or not.

### Fix 2: Grant the Pokemon Go app Location Access

Turning on the location services on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max is not enough and you need to grant the GPS access to the Pokemon Go app. To fix the Pokemon Go GPS problem on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, simply visit its Settings > Privacy > Location Services. Now, from the list of the installed apps, select Pokemon Go and make sure it can access the GPS on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max while running (or always).

### Fix 3: Set Precise Location for Pokemon Go

In case the Pokemon Go GPS is not accurate on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max, then you can enable the “Precise Location” option for the app. This will make sure that Pokemon Go can access the exact location of your phone.

To fix these Pokemon Go GPS issues, you can go to your phone’s Settings > Privacy > Location Services and select Pokemon Go. From the location sharing option, make sure the Precise Location feature is enabled.

![iphone precise location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/iphone-precise-location.jpg)

### Fix 4: Step Into an Open Area

If you're currently in an area with poor GPS reception due to buildings or trees, try moving to an open area with a clear view of the sky. This can significantly improve your GPS signal strength.

### Fix 5: Restart the App and the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device

Lastly, you can just reload the Pokemon Go app or restart your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max if you still get the Pokemon Go no GPS signal. You can just go to the app drawer and swipe up the Pokemon Go card to close the app.

## Part 3: How to Fix the Pokemon Go No GPS Signal Issues on Android?

Just like iPhone models, fixing the Pokemon Go GPS problem on Android phones is pretty easy and can be done in the following way:

![android location services](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/android-location-services.jpg)

Meltan, the mythical Pokemon is also described as a Hex Nut Pokemon. A major part of its body is built from liquid metal and its shape is fluid.
