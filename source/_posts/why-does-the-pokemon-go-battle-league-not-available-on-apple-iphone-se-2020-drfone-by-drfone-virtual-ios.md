## Why does the pokemon go battle league not available On Apple iPhone SE (2020)

After the incredible hype of finally getting the chance to battle other players, trainers hit a wall marked – Pokémon Go battle leagues Not Available.

It’s not the first time trainers have experienced bugs in the game and a long wait during maintenance breaks, but patience wears thin as after 2 weeks into the release of the super hyped Battle League, trainers all around the world are yet to have access to it.

The root cause of this disappointing course of events was a major bug in the first season of the Battle League. Some players could simply use “charged moves” repetitively without recharging. Thankfully Niantic is coming up with a fix.

## Part 1: What are the Go battle league known issues?

Pokémon Go as a game, is constantly evolving to improve the trainer’s experience which involves finding issues and resolving them. Like all other games, the publisher always tries their best to make the user experience more enriching and fair for the users.

Season 1 of the Battle League’s had a severe bug that a handful of players exploited to rise to the leader board. After a player has lodged few fast moves, (number of fast moves required for each Pokémon to charge attack, varies) the trainer’s Pokémon can lodge a secondary yet stronger charged attack to deal more damage.

The bug in the series implied that a Pokémon – “Melmetal” is able to recharge their charge attack even while attacking with a “Charged” move, essentially making the trainer using the Pokémon invincible during a real battle.

Several trainers immediately tweeted this excruciating bug to Niantic requesting this issue to be resolved immediately, as a result Niantic had to freeze the leader board for that season.

Players when entering the Battle League are shown – Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available Right Now, and all matches that were in progress were not concluded.

![pokemon 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-1.jpg)

Thankfully, the issue has been resolved and trainers can get back into the league without any change in the previous features.

Here’s a set of few known issues in the game currently being investigated by Niantic, which we can hope to see resolved later on in the future;

- **Inconsistent Fast Attacks against Opponent Charged Attacks –** Your fast attacks don’t land a direct hit when the opponent is throwing his Charged Attack.
- **Fast Attacks are slower on Android –** Most android users are experiencing slower fast attacks than iOS users. Niantic has addressed the issue and are awaiting more reports on the issue.
- **Charged Attack Button doesn’t work when tapped -** Occasionally after few uses, the Charged Attack button fails to respond when tapped resulting in slower attacks during matches.
- **Go Battle wins are not counted –** Some times, a Go battle win is not counted in the Go Battle League Set and remains unrecorded in the journal.
- **Animation Glitch of the trainer throwing a Poke ball –** A glitch occurs occasionally when the trainer avatar is seen throwing a Poke Ball repetitively.
- **Disappearance of the Charged Attack and Switch Button –** The button of the Charge Attack and the Switch Pokémon button would eventually disappear in-enabling the trainer to take any action during live battle.
- **Next Battle tab not showing up on the Post-win Screen –** After ending a match or winning a battle, the button for the ‘Next Battle’ option disappears from the Post-win screen.

## Part 2: Why does the go battle not available?

It’s not new for an augmented reality game to have bugs that impede on the fun aspect of the game, but the recent development to Pokémon Go included an update trainers have been waiting for since its release in 2016.

Battle League is a brand new additional feature to the game that allows players to play PVP or one on one matches with other trainers. Ninantic introduced Battle tournaments to be played in three leagues – Great, Ultra and Master, that gives trainers the opportunity to compete and gain dominance over score board.

Pokémon Go is now exploring its roots with Pvp being a part of the original game franchise. We can hope to see the game evolve into a platform for global players to go head to head with each other.

The first season of Pokémon Go Battle League had to be temporarily frozen due to prevalence of broken code (a.k.a. – bug) that created a loophole allowing certain players and unfair advantage.

After attacking your opponent with a Charge move, the move set requires a brief time to recharge in order for the player to be able to use it again.

Few players with the assist of Melmetal (ground and steel type) could lodge constant fast attacks while also using Charge moves with no recharge time. This landed a handful these players to skyrocket to the leader board.

![pokemon 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-2.jpg)

After this issue was tweeted to the notice of the game publisher, Ninattic temporarily paused Battle League. Trainers while accessing the live tournament event would be notified with – “Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available” by the game.

Although this doesn’t mean that trainers wouldn’t be able to play practice matches or close proximity matches. Battle League presents itself as an event in the game which gives trainers the chance to earn bonuses and stardust.

Even so, Pokémon Go continues to resolve issues as they come along and this shows us how there is so much more to look forward to. Battle Leagues, since its debut has had 4 seasons till now and trainers are all pumped for Season 5.

Here’s a list of exciting updates that will be included in the upcoming season;

- At Rank 7 you will encounter a Legendary Pokémon on the Go Battle League battle tracks as similar to the Legendary Pokémon encountered in 5star raids.
- To reach Rank 2 a trainer will need to complete a number of Battles in order to progress.
- From Rank 3 all the way to Rank 10, a higher number of battles must be won to proceed.
- Season 5 will be completed once you reach rank 7 which will earn you the Elite Charged TM rather than an Elite Fast TM.
- In Season 5 few Pokémon’s will get new updated move sets which the trainers can use to train and prepare for upcoming tournaments.

## Part 3: Tips you want to level up your pokemon go?

The basics you need to learn to play Pokémon go is catching Pokémon and powering them up. Other than that there are ways you can speed power up your Pokémon to increase CP to higher levels. The overall Pokémon’s collected, evolved or powered up, and battles fought in Battle League will win you points to level up in Pokémon Go.

Although it might seem like a long and hard journey, it doesn’t need to. You can catch and power up Pokémon faster and cover longer distances with some help from WondershareDr.Fone. With smoother and easier GPS spoofing you can cover Poke stops much quicker.

Here’s some tips you can put to easy use in Levelling Up in Pokémon Go:

### Tip #1: Use dr.fone Virtual Location

Use Wondershare [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to easily teleport to catch more poke stops at an adjustable speed and free-hand direction. The program is easy to use and a quicker way to grab more powerful Pokémon using lure.

There are several adjustments to the program that makes it fun to use. You can adjust the speed according km/hr so that the speed of the pointer would be determined as either walking, biking or driving in the game. This increases your chances to catch Pokémon at your desired pace.

- You can also evolve weaker Pokémon and harvest them for candy which you can use to power up your star Pokémon.

### Tip #4

## Is Mega Mewtwo The Strongest Pokémon On Apple iPhone SE (2020)?

With the introduction of Pokémon Red and Blue and the following cartoon series, Charmander, Bulbasaur, and Squirtle to name a few have become cultural icons. However, there’s no Pokémon that can match the enthusiasm that fans of the series get on seeing Mewtwo. In this post, we’re going to talk about Mega Mewtwo X & Y. So, read on to find out how to evolve into a shiny version of Mewtwo and tips to get this Pokémon.


## Part 1: What Is Mega Mewtwo In Pokémon?

Mewtwo is a Psychic-type Legendary Pokémon that’s introduced in Gen 1. Though it is not known for evolving into or from any other Pokémon, Mewtwo is capable of Mega Evolving into different forms known as –

Mega Mewtwo X from Mewtwonite X  
Mega Mewtwo Y from Mewtwonite Y  
Mega Mewtwo X is bulkier and bigger than its normal state. On the other hand, Mega Mewtwo Y is lighter and smaller than its normal state.

## Part 2: How to Evolve Into Shiny Mega Mewtwo?

Mega Evolution was introduced in Pokémon X and Y and was then expanded with the introduction of Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. When specific Pokémon holds the right Mega Stone, they can do temporary Mega Evolutions in the battle. The Mega Evolutions provide the Pokémon massive stat boost and new capabilities.

Below is the step-by-step guide to help you learn how to evolve into Shiny Mega Mewtwo-

**Step 1:** You have to do some work before getting access to Mega Evolutions. Performing and finishing these tasks will help you get the item you require to perform Mega Evolutions. Acquire the Rumble Badge from Shalour Gym through defeating Korrina.

**Step 2:** Go to the peak of the Tower of Mystery after the fight and talk to Korrina to get the Mega Ring.

**Step 3:** Now, it’s time to upgrade the Mega Ring. Well, the upgraded ring isn’t essential for all Mega Evolutions but is needed to locate the hidden Mega Stones. Professor Sycamore is going to upgrade your Mega Ring at the Anistar Sundial after defeating your opponent in Kiloude City. It’s not possible after you complete the main story.

**Step 4:** In order to perform a Mega Evolution, the Pokémon needs to hold a special Mega Stone. These Mega Stones are unique to each Pokémon. Only some Pokémon can Mega Evolve with them and Mewtwo is one of them. For Mewtwo, the location of Mega Stones is Unknown Dungeon.

**Step 5:** Give the Mega Stone to that corresponding Pokémon for holding as it is required for Pokémon to hold its Mega Stone in order to perform Mega Evolution.

**Step 6:** You can perform Mega Evolution in battles and only one of your Pokémon can perform Mega Evolution per battle. Your Pokémon will remain in its Mega form until the fight is complete or it faints.

That’s how to evolve into Mega Mewtwo. As you can now see that the first and most important step is to beat Korrina in order to mega evolve.

## Part 3: What Is Mega Mewtwo Worth?

No other Pokémon is as all-powerful, immortal, and invincible as the Mewtwo from series of Pokémon. With his sheer psychic capabilities, Mewtwo is capable of controlling whoever he desires and whatever he desires, and it includes the Earth’s weather. In the latest additions, Mewtwo two Mega Evolutions placed him among the strongest and fastest Pokémon.

If Mewtwo performs Mega Evolution into one of its forms, it takes back its quite well-deserved position as the most powerful Pokémon, with a base stat of 780.

So, Yes!! Mega Mewtwo is the strongest Pokémon.

And if you’re one of those who love to collect Pokémon cards and thinking of getting M Mewtwo EX, then you should be probably wondering about its worth on the market. Isn’t, it right? Then, it starts at $9.99.

## Part 4: How to Get Mega Mewtwo X And Y?

In order to get or evolve into Mega Mewtwo X or Mega Mewtwo Y, you need a special Mega Stone for your Pokémon. In Part 2 of this post, we have given in-depth detail about how to get the job done. Nevertheless, below we have covered some other tips to catch Mega Mewtwo X And Y:

However, there would come a scenario when you find yourself in the need of changing location in your Pokémon game. For instance, Pokémon Go requires you to go out and discover different areas in order to get and catch Pokémons, many people seek ways to spoof their locations. And that’s when [Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) comes in very handy. This app can help you trick all location-based apps on your Apple iPhone SE (2020).

![virtual location 03](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

To perform Mega Evolution, you need to beat gym leader, Korrina. And this creature uses 2 Fighting-type Pokémon and a Flying/Fighting-type Pokémon. You should use fast and strong flying-type/psychic-type Pokémon and attack in order to make fast work of these three.

It’s worth mentioning here that performing Mega Evolution of Mewtwo in Pokémon Go is yet not possible. Soon, Mewtwo will be in the list of Pokémon Go Mega Evolutions.

## The Bottom Line

That’s all on Mewtwo Mega Evolution. Yes, Mega Mewtwo is the strongest Pokémon. To perform its Mega Evolution, it must hold its own special Mega Stone - Mewtwonite X or Mewtwonite Y. Trainers have to wear a bracelet called Mega Ring and it can be acquired at the Tower of Mastery in Shalour City, but you need to defeat the Gym Leader for that. With both things accessible, you can select the Mega Evolution option with an attack. Keep in mind that only one Pokémon per trainer is capable of Mega Evolving during each battle. Once a Pokémon is in its Mega form, it remains in that form until the battle completes.
