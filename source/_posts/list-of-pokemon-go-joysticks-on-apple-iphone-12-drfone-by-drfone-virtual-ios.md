## Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?

In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.

Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.

## Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?

Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.

These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.

****Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store****

Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.

![Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg)

****Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go****

Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.

![Add Pokestop Lure Module](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg)

That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.

For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.

## Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?

With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.

****Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby****

You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.

In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.

****Use Lure Modules with Friends****

Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you/your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.

## Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?

## Where Is the Best Place to Catch Dratini On Apple iPhone 12

Dratini is a rare Pokemon that can be found in the wild. It is a Dragon-type Pokemon that evolves into Dragonair and then into Dragonite. Dratini is a popular Pokemon among players due to its rarity and powerful evolution. If you are looking to catch Dratini on your Apple iPhone 12, you may be wondering where the best place to find them is.

Dratini is one of the Pokémon creatures that resemble a snake. It has an elongated blue body with a blue white underside. It carries three-pronged fins on each side of its head which are white in color. Dratini also has a white bump on the forehead.

Dratini has an energy level that is constantly increasing, which makes it grow and can reach a length of more than 6 feet. It sheds its skin every time it has to grow, and usually hide behind a waterfall when shedding. The colony of Dratini lives underwater, living at the bottom feeding on food that falls from the upper levels. Outrage is the signature move for this Pokémon creature.

## Part 1: What’s the evolution of Dratini?

Dratini undergoes two different evolutions

The first un-evolved version is the serpentine Dratini that looks like a snake and continues shedding its skin as it grows. When you get to level 30, Dratini evolves into Dragonair, and at level 55 it becomes Dragonite

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Dragonair

This is an evolution of Dratini, which has a long scaly serpent-like body. It still retails the blue body with a white underside. The white bump on the forehead now becomes a white horn. The budding wings on the side of the head have now grown into full wings. It also carries three crystal orbs, with one on the neck and the other two on the tail.

Dragonair has the ability to stretch its wings so it can fly. It has a huge amount of energy in the body and can discharge the energy through the crystals. The energy that it releases has the ability to change the weather wherever it is. Dragonair can be found in seas and lakes.

### Dragonite

This is a Pokémon character that truly resembles a dragon and is the second evolution of Dratini. It has a yellow thick body, and a couple of antennae that come out of its forehead. It has a striated underbelly. The body is quite large when compared to the small wings.

Dragonite can fly at very high speeds despite its bulky appearance. It is a kindhearted Pokémon, which is as intelligent as a human being. It has been found to have tendencies to save humans from disasters, such as saving those who have come from a capsized ship on the high seas. It lives near the sea and is extremely rare in the Pokémon world.

## Part 2: Where can I find the Dratini nest?

Dratini is a Pokémon that lives in the water. Since it loves lakes and seas, you can find it when you visit areas that are near water. For example, in the United States, the most famous nests for Dratini are found in North Eastern San Francisco, Pier 39 and Pier 15. You will always find Dratini at these sites and they are famous for people who want to farm Dratini.

You may also g West to Squirtle Nest where you can get a lot of Dratini.

Dratini has a 5% spawning chance every day, so if you have the time, you can spend it on these sites as you enjoy the watery view and wait for it to appear.

Dratini nests can also be found in other parts of the world, such as Tokyo, Japan; Sydney and New South Wales, Australia; Paris, France and others.

## Part 3: Are the Dratini nest and spawn spot in the same place?

This is quite a common question for those who are new to the Pokémon universe. Basically, Dratini nests and spawn points are the same for a period of two weeks. The nests then migrate leaving the spawn points to spawn different types of Pokémon.

If the Dratini nest migrates, it can still come back in the future. You should always keep an eye at the spawn point where you first encountered your first Dratini Nest; it may come back once more and you can continue farming Dratini.

Dratini nests will migrate on alternate Thursdays at midnight. The nest migrations are random, so make sure that you visit and hit them many times over the two weeks in order to get the most Dratini that you can.

## Part 4: How to increase the possibility of earning Pokémon Go Dratini?

As mentioned earlier, Dratini can be found in certain places around the world. If you live outside these regions, you cannot be able to get Dratini. The best way to go about getting Dratini in such cases is to virtually relocate your device. This means that you can take your device to Tokyo nest sites even if you live in Africa.

The best app to use for teleportation is [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

**Features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)**

- Use the joystick feature to move around the map until you come across Dratini.
- The app allows you to seem to be walking, riding a bike, or in a vehicle, on the map. This simulates real-time travel data, which is important when playing Pokémon Go.
- Any app that relies on geo-location data can safely use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for teleportation.

**A step-by-step guide to spoof your location using Dr.Fone Virtual Location (iOS)**

On the official Dr.Fone page, download and install Dr.Fone on your computer or you can click the Download button below to download it directly. Launch it and then go to the Home screen and click on “Virtual Location”.

## In conclusion

Dratini is one of the most friendly but rare Pokémon to get. It can evolve from a small serpentine worm, into a might, good-hearted dragon. This is one of the Pokémon that people love to farm for trading and taking part in raids and such events.

When you need to, you can teleport your device to an area where Dratini is popular using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) (iOS). Use the Dratini nest maps to find Dratini, and then visit the area or teleport there.
