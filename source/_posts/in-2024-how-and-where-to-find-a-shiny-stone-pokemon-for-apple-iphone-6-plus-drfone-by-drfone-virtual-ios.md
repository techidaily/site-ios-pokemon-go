## Part 4: How to Win Pokemon Go Trainer Battles by Catching Powerful Pokemons

Now when you have added trainer codes in Pokemon Go, you can easily fight with other players. Though, if you want to win more battles, then you need to have the most powerful and meta Pokemons. To catch the Pokemons of your choice remotely, you can use a location spoofing tool like [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/).

- A part of the Dr.Fone toolkit, it will let you spoof the location of your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to anywhere you like.
- Players can enter the exact coordinates of the Pokemon’s spawning location or provide its address.
- The interface of the application has a map, letting you browse the area and drop the pin anywhere you like.
- Besides that, the tool can further help you simulate the movement of your device between multiple spots.
- You can use a GPS joystick to move realistically and at a preferred speed. There is no need to jailbreak your device to use Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS).
