Once you have got your hands on Sinnoh Stones and now you want to know where they should be used, there’s numerous 4th generation Pokémon who require Sinnoh Stone for their upgrade. Mamoswine is one of the best if you're prioritizing attackers for a raid because it has a mix of extremely high CP with the strong ground and ice-type moves.
