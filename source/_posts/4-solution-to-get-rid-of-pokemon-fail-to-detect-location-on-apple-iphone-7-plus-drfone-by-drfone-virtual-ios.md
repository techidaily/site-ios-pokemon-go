## A Detailed Pokemon Go PvP Tier List to Make you a Pro Trainer For Apple iPhone 7 Plus

If you have been playing Pokemon PvP battle leagues, then you might already know how tough the competition is. To win more matches and rank-up, players take the assistance of a Pokemon Go PvP tier list. With the help of a tier list, you can know what Pokemons to pick and identify some of the strongest contenders. In this post, I’m going to share dedicated Pokemon Go great, ultra, and master tier lists to help you pick the best Pokemons.

![pokemon go pvp tier list banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-pvp-tier-list-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: How are Pokemon Go PvP Tier Lists Evaluated?

Before you go through our carefully calculated great, ultra, and master league Pokemon Go tier list, you should know some basics. Ideally, the following parameters are considered while placing any Pokemon in a tier list.

**Moves:** The most important factor is the amount of damage any move can do. For instance, some moves like thunderbolt are more powerful than others.

**Pokemon type:** The type of Pokemon also plays a vital role. You might already know that some Pokemon types can easily be countered while others have fewer counters.

**Updates:** Niantic keeps updating Pokemon levels to have a balanced Pokemon Go PvP tier list. That’s why the current nerf or buff on any Pokemon would change their position in the list.

**CP levels:** Since the three leagues have CP limits, the overall CP value of any Pokemon is also vital to place them in a tier list.

![cp levels pokemon leagues](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-levels-pokemon-leagues.jpg)

## Part 2: A Complete Pokemon Go PvP Tier List: Great, Ultra, and Master Leagues

Since Pokemon Go PvP matches are based on different leagues, I have also come up with Pokemon ultra, great, and master league tier lists to help you pick the most powerful Pokemon in every match.

### Pokemon Go Great League Tier List

In Great League matches, the maximum CP of any Pokemon can be 1500. Considering this in mind, I have picked the following Pokemons from tier 1 (most powerful) to tier 5 (least powerful).

<table><tbody><tr><td>Tier 1 (5/5 rating)</td><td>Altaria, Skarmory, Azumarill, and Glarian Stunfisk</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td>Tier 2 (4.5/5 rating)</td><td>Umbreon, Swampert, Lanturn, Stunfisk, Dexoxys, Venusaur, Haunter, Jirachi, Lapras, Mew, and Whiscash</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 3 (4/5 rating)</td><td>Ivysaur, Uxie, Alolan Ninetales, Scrafty, Mawile, Wigglytuff, Clefable, Marshtomp, and Skuntank</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 4 (3.5/5 rating)</td><td>Qwilfish, Dustox, Glalie, Raichu, Dusclops, Serperior, Minun, Chandelure, Venomoth, Bayleef, and Golbat</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 5 (3/5 rating)</td><td>Pidgeot, Slowking, Garchomp, Golduck, Entei, Crobat, Jolteon, Duosion, Buterfree, and Sandslash</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pokemon Go Ultra League Tier List

You might already know that in the ultra league, we are allowed to pick Pokemons of up to 2500 CP. Therefore, you can pick Tier 1 and 2 Pokemons and avoid the low-level Tier 4 and 5 Pokemons.

<table><tbody><tr><td>Tier 1 (5/5 rating)</td><td>Registeel and Giratina</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td>Tier 2 (4.5/5 rating)</td><td>Snorlax, Alolan Muk, Togekiss, Poliwrath, Gyarados, Steelix, and Blastoise</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 3 (4/5 rating)</td><td>Regice, Ho-Oh, Meltmetal, Suicune, Kingdra, Primeape, Cloyster, Kangaskhan, Golem, and Virizion</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 4 (3.5/5 rating)</td><td>Crustle, Glaceon, Piloswine, Latios, Jolteon, Sawk, Leafeon, Braviary, and Mesprit</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 5 (3/5 rating)</td><td>Celebi, Scyther, Latias, Alomomola, Durant, Hypno, Muk, and Roserade</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pokemon Go Master League Tier List

Lastly, in the Master League, we don’t have any CP limits for Pokemons. Keeping this in mind, I have included some of the most powerful Pokemons in Tier 1 and 2 here.

<table><tbody><tr><td>Tier 1 (5/5 rating)</td><td>Togekiss, Groudon, Kyogre, and Dialga</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td>Tier 2 (4.5/5 rating)</td><td>Lugia, Mewtwo, Garchomp, Zekrom, Metagross, and Melmetal</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 3 (4/5 rating)</td><td>Zapdos, Moltres, Machamp, Darkrai, Kyurem, Articuno, Jirachi, and Rayquaza</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 4 (3.5/5 rating)</td><td>Gallade, Golurk, Usie, Cresselia, Entei, Lapras, and Pinsir</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 5 (3/5 rating)</td><td>Scizor, Crobat, Electivire, Emboar, Sawk, Victini, Exeggutor, Flygon, and Torterra</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Part 3: How to Catch Powerful Pokemons Remotely?

As you can see from the top tier Great league Pokemon Go list that the tier 1 and 2 Pokemons can help you win more matches. Since catching them could be tough, you can take the assistance of [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). It is a user-friendly application that would help you spoof your Apple iPhone 7 Plus location to catch any Pokemon remotely.

- With just a few clicks, you can easily change the present location of your Apple iPhone 7 Plus to any other place.
- On the application, you can enter the target location’s address, name, or even its exact coordinates.
- The application is extremely easy to use and provides a map-like interface to drop the pin to the exact target location.
- Besides that, the tool can also help you simulate the movement of your device between multiple spots at any speed.
- You can also use a GPS joystick to simulate your movement naturally and there is no need to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 7 Plus to use Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS).

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

There you go! I’m sure that after going through this Pokemon Go PvP tier list, you would be able to pick the strongest Pokemons in every league match. If you don’t have Tier 1 and 2 Pokemons already, then I would recommend using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS). Using it, you can catch any Pokemon remotely from the comfort of your home without jailbreaking your device.

## A Working Guide For Pachirisu Pokemon Go Map On Apple iPhone 7 Plus

_**“I have been trying to catch Pachirisu for a while now, but I can’t seem to locate it anywhere. Can someone tell me about a working Pachirisu Pokemon Go map?”**_

If you are also planning to catch this electric-type Pokemon, then you can have a similar query as well. Since Pachirisu is a region-specific Pokemon, chances are that you might not see it spawning everywhere. Though, if you use the right Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, then you can easily locate it. In this post, I’m going to suggest some working Pachirisu regional maps so that you can catch this Pokemon like a pro.


## Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu

### What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?

Due to the many tinkles around Pachirisu, this part will delve into every detail of this Pokemon. It’s a squirrel-like creature that can glide after spreading its arms. This electric-type Pokemon is region-exclusive and only available in the Sinnoh region. The best moves of Pachirisu are Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, which are perfect for defense and offense.

It's an EleSquirrel Pokemon that can win battles in rainy weather. Pachirisu is good against flying, steel, and electric-type Pokemon GO moves, whereas it is vulnerable to ground-type moves. This cute little guy would be an excellent pick in battles that can attack with fur balls.

You can evolve it into Mega Pachirisu with mega gems, but more evolution isn’t possible. Now, let's look at some stats in the table below to understand it better:

<table><tbody><tr><td><b>Pokemon No</b></td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td><b>Maximum CP</b></td><td>1372</td></tr><tr><td><b>Attack</b></td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stamin</b>a</td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td><b>Defense</b></td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td><b>Height</b></td><td>0.4m</td></tr><tr><td><b>Weight</b></td><td>3.9kg</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Where to catch Pachirisu?

As you know, some Pokemons like Pachirisu can be region-specific. Mostly, it is observed that Pachirisu is spawned in the northern regions of Canada, Alaska, and Russia. You can find it in the wildering, electric hubs, parks, and even some colder regions. Since it can hide pretty well, you would have to keep a keen eye to look for it. A Pokemon Go regional map for Pachirisu can further help you.

### Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?

As introduced before, Pachirisu is primarily found in areas of Alaska, Canada, and certain parts of Russia. If you are in one of these regions, you have a chance to encounter and catch Pachirisu in the wild.

As for providing specific coordinates for Pachirisu locations, it is important to note that Pokémon spawns can change frequently and depend on various factors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide fixed coordinates for Pachirisu encounters as they can vary over time.

To increase your chances of finding Pachirisu, it is recommended to visit areas with a higher likelihood of spawning regional exclusives, such as parks, tourist attractions, or areas with a diverse range of Pokémon spawns. Additionally, participating in Pokémon Go events or connecting with local Pokémon Go communities can provide valuable information on Pachirisu sightings in your region.

## Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You

Since Pachirisu is mostly spawned in Alaska, Canada, and Russia, you might need to take some extra measures to locate it. I would recommend these Pachirisu Pokemon Go spawn maps to assist you.

### 1\. The Silph Road

The Silph Road is the biggest crowd-sourced Pokemon Go map that will let you know about the recently spawning of Pachirisu. Since the directory has data about tons of Pokemons, you can go to its filters and select Pachirisu to save time. This will let you know the recent spawning of the Pokemon with its exact coordinates.

**Website:** [https://thesilphroad.com/](https://thesilphroad.com/)

### 2\. Poke Map

If you are looking for an active Pachirisu Pokemon Go map, then you can head to this freely available website. You can know the active regions where the Pokemon has been found recently. Not just that, it will also let you know about other details of the game like raids, Pokestops, gyms, etc.

**Website:** [https://www.pokemap.net/](https://www.pokemap.net/)

### 3\. PoGo Map

Earlier, PoGo Map was available as an app, but now you can only use its website to know the spawning of Pokemons. Since it is a global directory, you can easily use it as a Pachirisu map for Pokemon Go. You can zoom in to know the spawn location of Pachirisu with its coordinates or the exact address. Besides Pachirisu, it can also help you catch several other regional Pokemons as well.

**Website:** [https://www.pogomap.info/location/](https://www.pogomap.info/location/)

### 4\. PokeHunter

PokeHunter is a well-known Pokemon GO tracker that provides exact information on PokeStops and gyms. It will inform you about the Pachirisu, ex-Raid battles, and locations of other Pokémon characters. With real-time tracking, it is accessible to all devices, such as PCs and mobile phones. Besides, this map can show the energy level of Pokemon and let you decide which to catch.

## Part 3: How to Catch Pachirisu on Pokemon Go from Home?

If you don’t live in Canada, Alaska, or Russia, where Pachirisu is naturally spawned, then catching it can be tough. To make things easier, you can just use a location spoofer application. While there are plenty of mock GPS apps for Android devices, iPhone users often find it hard to spoof their device location. Well, in this case, I would suggest [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 7 Plus location without jailbreaking it.

With just a few clicks, you can directly teleport to anywhere in the world by entering the location’s address or its coordinates. Furthermore, you can use the application to simulate your movement and even use its GPS joystick to move smoothly. Once you have noted the coordinates or address from the Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, you can follow these steps:

**Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 7 Plus and launch the tool**

To start with, just launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) application on your computer and connect your Apple iPhone 7 Plus to it. Grant the application the needed permissions, agree to the terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.

![virtual location 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 2: Teleport to any other location**

![virtual location 03](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Now, go to the search bar and just enter the address of the target location or its coordinates that you can get from a Pachirisu Pokemon Go map.

Simply adjust the pin on the map so that you can drop it to the desired spot. Click on the “Move Here” button in the end to spoof your Apple iPhone 7 Plus location.

![virtual location 05](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

**Step 3: Simulate your movement**

Furthermore, you can even simulate your device movement to ensure that you visit the correct Pachirisu Pokemon Go spawn map location. You can go to the one-stop or multi-stop mode on the screen and drop the pins on the map. This will form a route on which you can simulate your movement at the speed of your choice.

![virtual location 12](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png)

If you want to move naturally, then you can use the GPS joystick that would be enabled at the bottom of the screen. You can use your keyboard shortcuts or the mouse pointer to move in any route realistically.
