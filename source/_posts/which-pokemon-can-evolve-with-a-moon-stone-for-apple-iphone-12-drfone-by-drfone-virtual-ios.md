## Part 2: Risk of installing ipogo and running

You can come across a certain risks also when you are installing and running iPogo. These are as follows:

**Jailbreaking is required:**

For using iPogo, jailbreaking is required, and it refers to the privilege to Apple devices through which they can remove all the software restrictions. If there is any loss to the data, a user will be responsible for it.

**Chances to get banned:**

iPogo is an application that can be used after jailbreaking only. After doing the jailbreaking, the chances are there that your device might get banned. You are at a high risk where certain problems may arise.

**Can lose access to content:**

There might be a chance you have will lose access to content as well. Therefore we suggest you avoid. If you still want to jailbreak your device and want to install iPogo, it is entirely your choice.
