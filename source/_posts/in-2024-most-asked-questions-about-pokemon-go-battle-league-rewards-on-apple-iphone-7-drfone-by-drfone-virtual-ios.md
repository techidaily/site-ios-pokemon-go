- **Great League:** Max 1500 CP for Pokemons
- **Ultra League:** Max 2500 CP for Pokemons
- **Master League:** No CP limit for Pokemons

Apart from that, three different cups would be organized in the season 5 Pokemon Go Battle League.

- **Little Cup (9th to 16th November):** Pokemons with only the first stage of evolution cycle and maximum CP of 500.
- **Kanto Cup (16th to 23rd November):** Pokemons from the Kanto index with a maximum CP of 1500.
- **Catch Cup (23rd to 30th November):** Pokemons that are caught from the starting of season 5 (excluding mythical Pokemons) of maximum 1500 CP.

## Tips to Level-up in Pokemon Battle Leagues

As stated, if you want to get more battle league Pokemon rewards, then you must level-up higher. Here are some of the tips that you can follow to level-up in the game easily.

### Tip 1: Have a Balanced Team

Most of the rookie PvP trainers make the common mistake of only picking attack-based Pokemons with fewer defense stats. Try not to make this mistake and have a balanced team in which you have both attacking and defensive Pokemons. Also, try to get Pokemons of different types to counter your opponent’s picks.

![pokemon go pvp battle](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-pvp-battle.jpg)

### Tip 2: Know the Current Meta Tier

Just like any other PvP game, Pokemon Go Battle Leagues also has a tier-list. That is, some Pokemons are just more powerful than others. Therefore, before you pick your Pokemons, get to know about the current meta-list. This will help you pick more powerful Pokemons that can easily carry a game.

![meta pokemons in pvp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/meta-pokemons-in-pvp.jpg)

### Tip 3: Catch More Pokemons Easily

Since it is not feasible to step out and look for Pokemons, you can use a location spoofer tool instead. If you are an iPhone user, then you can try [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). It is a 100% reliable solution that can spoof your Apple iPhone 7 location anywhere you want without jailbreaking your device.

- The application has a map interface that would let you drop the pin anywhere you want in the world.
- Besides that, you can also simulate your movement between multiple stops at a preferred speed.
- A GPS joystick would also be enabled by the tool so that you can simulate your movement realistically.
- Using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) is extremely simple and it doesn’t need jailbreak access as well.
