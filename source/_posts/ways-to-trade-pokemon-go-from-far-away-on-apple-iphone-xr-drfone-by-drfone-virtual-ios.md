**Step 3:** After all the previous steps, the next step is to click on the “teleport mode” icon, which will be located in the upper-right part. This will activate the teleport mode. After that, you have to enter the name of the location or place where you wish to teleport to in the upper left field. Finally, tap on “Go”. As an example, we are going to enter “Italy”, Rome in the left field.

**Step 5:** If you have followed the directions accurately, your actual location on the map will now be set to “Italy”. You can confirm your location from the Pokemon Go’s map. Finally, below we have provided a screenshot of how the location will be shown.
