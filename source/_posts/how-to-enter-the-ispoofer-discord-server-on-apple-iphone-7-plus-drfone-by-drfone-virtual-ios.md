## How to enter the iSpoofer discord server On Apple iPhone 7 Plus

If you are an avid Pokemon Go player, you might have come across the name ‘iSpoofer’ at least once. It’s a GPS manipulation tool for iOS that’s designed to help users change their GPS location on an iPhone/iPad and access geo-restricted content. However, players mainly use it to virtually explore different cities in Pokemon Go and collect a wide variety of Pokemon. With a single click, you can change your current location and catch rare Pokemon without an effort.

But, since iSpoofer does not meet Apple’s verification measures, it frequently gets banned from the App Store. This is when you need iSpoofer Discord servers. These discord servers will keep you updated as soon as iSpoofer’s current version gets banned or when there’s a new version of the app in the market. Read this guide to understand what the iSpoofer discord server does and how you can enter such a discord channel to stay up-to-date with iSpoofer.


## Part 1: What does the iSpoofer discord do?

As we mentioned earlier, iSpoofer is a geo-spoofing app for iPhone/iPad. It lets you change your smartphone’s GPS location and play location-based games such as Pokemon Go. In general, people use iSpoofer to change their current location and virtually collect Pokemon without going out at all. Thanks to its Joystick feature, you can even control your movement while sitting on your couch itself. Since it allows users to collect a wide range of Pokemon without doing anything, the majority of people want to use iSpoofer to expand their Pokemon Go collection and boost their overall XP.

However, since iSpoofer is a ‘hack’ at the end of the day, Apple keeps banning it every now and then. To tackle this situation, the app gets registered under fake company names after every ban and this cycle continues forever. Since it can get pretty strenuous to know when the app is working and when the new version is released, people often rely on different iSpoofer Pokemon Go discord servers for relevant information.

Through these channels, you can find active iSpoofer links, the status of the current version, and how to get the latest working version of the app for your iDevice. You can enter one of these discord channels and you’ll no longer have to worry about scrolling through different websites to find relevant information about iSpoofer.

## Part 2: Why can't I find the valid iSpoofer discord server link?

So, how to enter an iSpoofer discord channel? Unfortunately finding a working iSpoofer discord server is not an easy task. The server links keep updating and once you accidentally leave a channel, it can get pretty strenuous to find a relevant channel. Moreover, the majority of iSpoofer discord channels right now are fake. This means that even if you join them, you won’t get any relevant information at all.

The easiest way to find working discord server links is to head to [Discord Server List](https://discordservers.me/), an online platform where you’ll find a list of 100% working discord server links. But, to make your hunting job easier, we have compiled a list of a few relevant here are a few iSpoofer discord server links that’ll always provide you with relevant information about iSpoofer.

### 1\. PokeNemo

![pokenemo](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokenemo.PNG)

[PokeNemo](https://discordservers.me/servers/701923235188441239) is among the most useful iSpoofer discord channels. While it’s not a dedicated iSpoofer server, it’ll keep you updated about everything about the app. In addition to this, you can also find relevant information about other spoofing tools, informative tutorials, specific coordinates for different Pokemon characters, etc.

### 2\. ShinyQuest

![shinyquest](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/shinyquest.PNG)

ShinyQuest is yet another reliable iSpoofer discord server where you can find a variety of spoofing tools for Pokemon Go. However, what makes ShinyQuest special is that you’ll get relevant information, dedicated giveaways, and random contests about the Shiny version of each Pokemon character. So, if you’re a fan of Shiny Pokemon, you can join ShinyQUest to stay updated all the time.

## Part 3: How to spoof on iOS without iSpoofer

Even though iSpoofer is a great tool, it’s safe to say that it’s quite hectic to use it for geo spoofing. It takes a lot of time and too much effort to know if iSpoofer is working or not. And, since Niantic and Apple are always ready to ban iSpoofer, you never know when it’ll stop working permanently.

So, is there a safer and more reliable option to fake GPS location for Pokemon Go. The answer is Yes! You can install [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) on your PC and use it to manipulate the GPS location of your iDevice. It’s a feature-rich spoofing tool that comes with a wide range of features. Not only can you use it to change your phone’s GPS location, but you can also control your GPS movement virtually.

It comes with a built-in GPS Joystick feature that supports keyboard control as well. This means you’ll be able to control your movement using different keyboard keys on your laptop/PC just like a game.

Let us walk you through the step-by-step process of using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) to fake GPS location on an iPhone/iPad.

**Step 1 -** Install and launch Dr.Fone on your PC. Click “Virtual Location” on its main screen to proceed further.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2 -** Now, connect your iDevice to the PC via lighting cable and click “Get Started”. If you’re using an iPad, simply grab the USB Type-C cable to connect it and wait for Dr.Fone to recognize the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device.

![virtual location 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3 -** As soon as the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device gets recognized, you’ll be prompted to a map that’ll be pointing to your current location.

**Step 4 -** Choose “Teleport Mode” from the top-right corner of the screen and use the search bar to find a location. For instance, if we want to set “Rome” as our fake location, simply type “Rome” in the search bar. You can also pinpoint a specific location by manually dragging the pointer.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 5 -** Finally, select the location and click “Move Here” to select it as your current GPS location.

![virtual location 05](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

That’s how quick and easy it is to change GPS location on an iDevice using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).

## Conclusion

iSpoofer is widely used as a “Pokemon Go hack” by many players and that’s why people always want to join working iSpoofer discord channels. However, since you can’t rely on iSpoofer every time, it would be better to use a more reliable alternative such as Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS). If you are also looking for a simpler solution than iSpoofer, make sure to install Dr.Fone right now.

## Will Pokémon Go Ban the Account if You Use PGSharp On Apple iPhone 7 Plus

According to the original gameplay, you need to be physically present on the battleground to catch the Pokémon. It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.

The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to [spoof Pokémon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html). But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.

There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.

In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.

## Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned

The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.

![pokemon go ban](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg)

The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:

- Engaging in harassment against any player in the game
- Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go
- Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo
- Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations

If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.

## Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp

Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.

Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.

Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.

### 2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban

To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.

Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.

![pgsharp plan](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg)

To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg)

Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency. Also, you can fake your personal details as it is a beta key.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-5.jpg)

Now, once you got the beta key, fill it in the login details to use the PGSharp. Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.

The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.

Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.

### 2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp

There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.

But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.

## Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?

Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account. You should not use your main account to fake GPS with PGSharp. First, create a PTC account and then install PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go without a ban.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-6.jpg)

Also, make sure to uninstall the official account to spoof the location to help you catch more Pokémon in less time.

## Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?

Spoofing on the iPhone is a little more difficult than on Android. So, if you own an iPhone, you can use [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to fake location.
