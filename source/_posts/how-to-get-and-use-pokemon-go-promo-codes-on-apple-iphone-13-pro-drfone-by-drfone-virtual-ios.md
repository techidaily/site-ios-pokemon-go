## How to Get and Use Pokemon Go Promo Codes On Apple iPhone 13 Pro

The steady increase in the number of Pokemon Go users has simultaneously led to the expansion of the software. And such is the use of **Pokemon Go promo codes** and Pokemon promo cards.

- Machoke
- Graveler
- Haunter
- Boldore

## Part 3: How to do the special trade?

You need a Special Trade whenever you wish to trade a legendary Pokemon or a shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Go. These pokemon are very rare to find and hence you won’t want to trade these rare Pokemons very often, however, you can trade a rare Pokemon only once per day. To trade a rare Pokemon would also need to be a Great or Best friend, two of the highest levels of friendship in the game Pokemon go. To increase your friendship level you need to battle and trade more and more. It'll take quite a bit of time to reach that stature of a friendship level. This could cost as much as one million, this amount will however decrease with increasing friendship levels.

Pokemon GO Spoofing on iOS is a method of faking the location on an iPhone or iPad to cheat in the popular augmented reality game, Pokémon GO.

### 2\. How does Pokémon GO Spoofing on iOS work?

By using third-party software or apps, you can manipulate the GPS location data on your iOS devices, tricking Pokémon GO into thinking you are in a different location, allowing you to catch Pokemon and access Pokestops that would otherwise be out of reach.

### 3\. Are there any risks for Pokémon Go Spoofing?

Yes, Spoofing in Pokémon Go is against the game's terms of service, and if caught, you may face a temporary or permanent suspension of your account. Additionally, many spoofing tools or apps also contain malware or viruses that can damage the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device or steal personal data. Therefore, finding a reliable **Pokemon Go spoofer iOS** is very important. Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location is a highly recommended tool for anyone who wants to change their GPS location on their iOS device safely and easily. As it does not require jailbreaking or any other unauthorized modifications to the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device, and it does not put the user's personal information at risk.



### 4\. Are there any alternatives to Pokémon GO Spoofing on iOS?

Yes, you can travel to different locations to catch new Pokémon or access new Pokéstops, or you can use in-game items to lure Pokemon to your location.

Now that you know about 11 different ways to do **Pokemon Go spoofing on iOS**, you can easily meet your requirements. As you can see, I have listed both iOS and desktop applications in this post with solutions for jailbroken and standard devices. Therefore, you can simply pick a preferred option for location spoofing on Pokemon Go on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro. However, if nothing else would work, then use a reliable VPN of your choice and be ready to catch as many Pokemon as you want!
