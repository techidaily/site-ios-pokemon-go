## How to enter the iSpoofer discord server On Apple iPhone XR

If you are an avid Pokemon Go player, you might have come across the name ‘iSpoofer’ at least once. It’s a GPS manipulation tool for iOS that’s designed to help users change their GPS location on an iPhone/iPad and access geo-restricted content. However, players mainly use it to virtually explore different cities in Pokemon Go and collect a wide variety of Pokemon. With a single click, you can change your current location and catch rare Pokemon without an effort.

But, since iSpoofer does not meet Apple’s verification measures, it frequently gets banned from the App Store. This is when you need iSpoofer Discord servers. These discord servers will keep you updated as soon as iSpoofer’s current version gets banned or when there’s a new version of the app in the market. Read this guide to understand what the iSpoofer discord server does and how you can enter such a discord channel to stay up-to-date with iSpoofer.


## Part 1: What does the iSpoofer discord do?

As we mentioned earlier, iSpoofer is a geo-spoofing app for iPhone/iPad. It lets you change your smartphone’s GPS location and play location-based games such as Pokemon Go. In general, people use iSpoofer to change their current location and virtually collect Pokemon without going out at all. Thanks to its Joystick feature, you can even control your movement while sitting on your couch itself. Since it allows users to collect a wide range of Pokemon without doing anything, the majority of people want to use iSpoofer to expand their Pokemon Go collection and boost their overall XP.

However, since iSpoofer is a ‘hack’ at the end of the day, Apple keeps banning it every now and then. To tackle this situation, the app gets registered under fake company names after every ban and this cycle continues forever. Since it can get pretty strenuous to know when the app is working and when the new version is released, people often rely on different iSpoofer Pokemon Go discord servers for relevant information.

Through these channels, you can find active iSpoofer links, the status of the current version, and how to get the latest working version of the app for your iDevice. You can enter one of these discord channels and you’ll no longer have to worry about scrolling through different websites to find relevant information about iSpoofer.

## Part 2: Why can't I find the valid iSpoofer discord server link?

So, how to enter an iSpoofer discord channel? Unfortunately finding a working iSpoofer discord server is not an easy task. The server links keep updating and once you accidentally leave a channel, it can get pretty strenuous to find a relevant channel. Moreover, the majority of iSpoofer discord channels right now are fake. This means that even if you join them, you won’t get any relevant information at all.

The easiest way to find working discord server links is to head to [Discord Server List](https://discordservers.me/), an online platform where you’ll find a list of 100% working discord server links. But, to make your hunting job easier, we have compiled a list of a few relevant here are a few iSpoofer discord server links that’ll always provide you with relevant information about iSpoofer.

### 1\. PokeNemo

![pokenemo](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokenemo.PNG)

[PokeNemo](https://discordservers.me/servers/701923235188441239) is among the most useful iSpoofer discord channels. While it’s not a dedicated iSpoofer server, it’ll keep you updated about everything about the app. In addition to this, you can also find relevant information about other spoofing tools, informative tutorials, specific coordinates for different Pokemon characters, etc.

### 2\. ShinyQuest

![shinyquest](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/shinyquest.PNG)

ShinyQuest is yet another reliable iSpoofer discord server where you can find a variety of spoofing tools for Pokemon Go. However, what makes ShinyQuest special is that you’ll get relevant information, dedicated giveaways, and random contests about the Shiny version of each Pokemon character. So, if you’re a fan of Shiny Pokemon, you can join ShinyQUest to stay updated all the time.

## Part 3: How to spoof on iOS without iSpoofer

Even though iSpoofer is a great tool, it’s safe to say that it’s quite hectic to use it for geo spoofing. It takes a lot of time and too much effort to know if iSpoofer is working or not. And, since Niantic and Apple are always ready to ban iSpoofer, you never know when it’ll stop working permanently.

So, is there a safer and more reliable option to fake GPS location for Pokemon Go. The answer is Yes! You can install [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) on your PC and use it to manipulate the GPS location of your iDevice. It’s a feature-rich spoofing tool that comes with a wide range of features. Not only can you use it to change your phone’s GPS location, but you can also control your GPS movement virtually.

It comes with a built-in GPS Joystick feature that supports keyboard control as well. This means you’ll be able to control your movement using different keyboard keys on your laptop/PC just like a game.

Let us walk you through the step-by-step process of using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) to fake GPS location on an iPhone/iPad.

**Step 1 -** Install and launch Dr.Fone on your PC. Click “Virtual Location” on its main screen to proceed further.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2 -** Now, connect your iDevice to the PC via lighting cable and click “Get Started”. If you’re using an iPad, simply grab the USB Type-C cable to connect it and wait for Dr.Fone to recognize the Apple iPhone XR device.

![virtual location 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3 -** As soon as the Apple iPhone XR device gets recognized, you’ll be prompted to a map that’ll be pointing to your current location.

**Step 4 -** Choose “Teleport Mode” from the top-right corner of the screen and use the search bar to find a location. For instance, if we want to set “Rome” as our fake location, simply type “Rome” in the search bar. You can also pinpoint a specific location by manually dragging the pointer.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 5 -** Finally, select the location and click “Move Here” to select it as your current GPS location.

![virtual location 05](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

That’s how quick and easy it is to change GPS location on an iDevice using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).

## Conclusion

iSpoofer is widely used as a “Pokemon Go hack” by many players and that’s why people always want to join working iSpoofer discord channels. However, since you can’t rely on iSpoofer every time, it would be better to use a more reliable alternative such as Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS). If you are also looking for a simpler solution than iSpoofer, make sure to install Dr.Fone right now.

To learn how to hatch Pokemon Go eggs without walking using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), the following steps can be taken.

**_Step 1: Connect your device and launch the app_**

Firstly, just connect your Apple iPhone XR to the application and launch the Wondershare Dr.Fone > Virtual Location feature.

![launch the Dr.Fone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Just agree to the terms and click on the "Get Started" button to launch the interface of Virtual Location and start Pokemon Go how to hatch eggs at home.

![launch Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**_Step 2: Walk between two stops_**

As the interface would be launched, you can see five different modes in the top-right corner. Just click on the third option (One-stop route) and look for any location from the search bar.

![walk mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

Now you can just select the number of times you wish to move and complete other settings, such as enabling the realistic and fluctuation mode. After that, click on the "Move Here" button.

![confirm marching](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

_**Tips:**  
1\. **Realistic Mode:** It enhances the realism of the simulation by fluctuating the speed during the simulation.  
2\. **Fluctuation Mode**: This feature enables you to move around within a 5-meter range after reaching your destination, instead of remaining static. This helps to make the GPS location change more realistic, making it less likely for Pokemon Go to detect the use of the virtual location._

This will just start the simulation, and you can even adjust the speed from a slider at the bottom.

![start the simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png)

**_Step 3: Move along multiple spots_**

Using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), you can also simulate an entire route between multiple spots as well. To do this, just click on the "Multi-stop route" which is the fourth option in the top-right corner of the interface.

![route between multiple spots](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

Now, you can mark multiple spots on the map and can also select the number of times you wish to take this route. Click on the "Start Moving" button to start **Pokemon Go hatch eggs without walking**.

![start walking](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png)

In the end, your location would be changed as the simulation would make Pokemon Go believe that you are taking the subsequent route. You can also change your walking speed from a slider as well.

In this way, you can learn how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking at the convenience of your home!



## Way 2: Use an Android Location Spoofer

This is one of the quickest ways to learn how to hatch Pokemon Go eggs without walking. If you own an Android device, then you can simply use a GPS spoofing app to manually change the location of your device. This will trick Pokemon Go into believing that you are walking instead. For iPhone users, the feature would need a jailbroken device though.

While changing your location, make sure that you do it tactfully. For instance, if an egg would need 10 kilometers of walking, then change your location gradually instead of just switching it in one go. Here’s **how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking** by using a GPS spoofer.

1. Firstly, unlock your Android phone and go to its Settings > About Phone to tap the Build Number field 7 times. This will unlock the Developer Options settings on your Android.

    ![unlock the Developer Options settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-2.jpg)

2. Now, go to the Play Store and install a reliable location spoofing app on your phone. Later, visit Settings > Developer Options and turn it on. Also, allow mock locations on the phone and choose the installed app from here.

    ![location spoofing app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-3.jpg)

3. That’s it! Now you can just launch the fake GPS app and manually change your location to a few meters away to trick Pokemon Go. Do the same a few times to cover a prominent distance.

    ![change your location to a few meters away](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-4.jpg)

Just be sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect that you are using a GPS spoofer to hatch eggs. The regular use of an app like this might result in your account ban.

## Way 3: Fix Your Apple iPhone XR on a Drone and Play Pokemon Go

Apart from a location spoofing app, there are a handful of other ways to learn how to hatch eggs without walking in Pokemon Go. Most of the eggs in Pokemon Go would need you to walk 2, 5, or 10 kilometers. The good news is that an average drone can easily cover this distance. Firstly, get a working drone on which you can easily place your phone. It is recommended to get a lock so that your device won’t fall while it is on a drone. Once your phone is successfully attached to a drone, just use it to cover a substantial distance. Make sure that the speed is minimal so that Pokemon Go would believe that you are walking instead.

![Play Pokemon Go with a drone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-5.jpg)

**Things to Remember**

- While doing so, don’t forget about the safety of your phone as it can get stolen by someone if it goes too far.
- Use a lock and make sure that your phone won’t fall from your drone.
- Enable the Find My Apple iPhone XR service on your Android or iPhone so that you can locate your phone if it is lost.
- Move your drone slowly so that Pokemon Go would not detect that you are using a drone or playing the game while driving.

## Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users

A while back, Pokemon Go enabled the option to add friends on the app and send them gifts. Presently, we can send gifts to 20 other friends from our account in a day. Therefore, if you have a lot of friends, then you can send them eggs, including the exclusive 7 km egg. There are tons of online sources and forums for people to exchange their friend codes for Pokemon Go.

1. Firstly, Launch Pokemon Go on your phone and go to your profile. Adjacent to the “Me” section, tap on the “Friends” section instead.

    ![go to your profile](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-6.jpg)

2. Here, you can see a list of your friends and an option to add more friends on Pokemon Go. To add a friend, you need to enter their code which can be obtained from any dedicated forum or even Reddit.
3. That’s it! Once you have added a friend, go to their profile, and choose to trade or send them a gift. For instance, you can send them an exclusive egg and help them hack eggs without walking.

    ![help friends hack eggs](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-7.jpg)

**Pro-Tip**

If you have a friend who goes for a jog or walks a lot, then you can just open Pokemon Go on their phone and let them cover the distance for you as well!

## Way 5: Use Your Pokecoins to Purchase More Incubators

You might already know that Pokecoins is the official currency of Pokemon Go. Using it, you can buy all kinds of tools, incense, eggs, incubators, and even Pokemons. Though, if you wish to learn how to hack eggs in Pokemon Go without moving, then consider getting some incubators. There are all kinds of incubators available in the game that can help you hatch eggs without walking much.

1. Firstly, make sure that you have enough Pokecoins with you. If not, launch the app and tap on the Pokeball from its home to visit its shop.
2. From here, you can buy as many Pokecoins as you want. For instance, $0.99 would let you purchase 100 Pokecoins.

    ![get Pokecoins](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-8.jpeg)

3. Great! Once you have enough Pokecoins, go to the Shop again and choose to buy eggs and incubators.
4. After getting enough incubators, you can go to your collection and apply more incubators to hatch eggs without walking.

    ![apply more incubators](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-9.jpg)

## Way 6: Make Use of Your Bike or Skateboard

This is one of the oldest tricks in the book to learn **how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking**. You can just place your phone carefully on your bike or skateboard and cover the needed distance to hatch more eggs. While you would still have to go out for this, the effort needed would be far less than walking.

Just make sure that you stay safe while riding your bike or skateboard. Don’t focus too much on catching new Pokemons. Instead, just cover the needed distance to hatch the egg. Also, ride your bike or skateboard slowly to make sure Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement.

![play Pokemon Go with Bike or Skateboard](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-10.jpg)

## Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go

If you have a Roomba or any other robotic cleaner in the house, then you can also take its assistance to hack Pokemon Go eggs. All you got to do is place your phone on the Roomba and let it move around in your house. Since the robotic cleaner would move slowly, it will make Pokemon Go believe that you are walking instead. Just be sure that your phone will stay safe and protected. I would recommend placing it in a waterproof lock to further protect it from any wear and tear.

![play Pokemon Go with Roomba](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-11.jpg)

## Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go

If you are already into model railroads, then you won’t face any issues playing Pokemon Go. It would be the replica of a big railroad with miniature trains. Simply place your phone on a miniature train and let it revolve around the railroad to cover the distance. Just keep your phone safe and regulate the speed of the train to make sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement. You would have to drive your train for a while to cover the distance, but you don’t have to walk to do it.

![Model Railroad](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-12.jpg)

## Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go

Do you have a turntable? If yes, you are lucky! You can use it that you used to listen to music to trick Pokemon Go that you're walking and hatch the eggs. Because the turntable creates enough motion in a wide enough circle that it will trick your phone's internal sensors into thinking you're walking. This trick is for anyone who wants to be a quick hatch in Pokemon Go! Here are the steps:

Place your phone on the outermost edge of the turntable > Turn on the turntable > Confirm if your eggs are starting to hatch. If not, readjust your device and try again.
