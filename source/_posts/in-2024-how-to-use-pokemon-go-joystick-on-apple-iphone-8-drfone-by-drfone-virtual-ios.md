## Part 1: What’s the Need for a Pokemon Go Joystick?

If you are an avid Pokemon Go player, then you might already know that the game demands us to step outside to catch Pokemons or participate in raids. Sadly, not everyone can travel so much on their own. Therefore, you might consider using a Pokemon Go joystick on iOS/Android under the following circumstances.

- In the current Covid-19 pandemic, you might be under a lockdown and can’t step out.
- You could have already explored your nearby areas and would like to catch more Pokemons.
- There could be any other health or environmental condition, stopping you from going out.
- The weather outside might not be suitable or safe to explore the Pokemon Go map on your own.
- Any other possible reason for not being able to travel solely or having enough time to catch Pokemons.

## Part 2: Possible Risks for Using a Pokemon Go Joystick

A Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution can easily change your present location in the game or even simulate your movement. Though, if you use the Pokemon Go joystick app multiple times a day and Niantic detects it, then it can cause some issues.

Please note that the use of any location spoofing or Pokemon Go hack (joystick) is against the terms of Niantic. Therefore, if your account is found using these hacks, then Niantic can display warning messages. If after getting multiple warnings, the hack is still being detected, then it can lead to a temporary or even a permanent ban of your account.

## Part 4: Tips to Avoid your Pokemon Go Account from Getting Banned

If you want to avoid getting your account banned and still use a reliable spoofing app for Pokemon Go, then consider the following tips:

- Try not to overly use the Pokemon Go joystick app all the time. It is recommended to use these apps 2-3 times a day only.
- Always consider the cooldown duration in mind before changing your location. For instance, avoid using the app for a while before moving from one place to another. If you move from London to Tokyo to New York the same day, then your account might get flagged.
- Try to spoof your location in the same district or state first and wait for a few hours before changing your whereabouts. The following cooldown duration chart would help you determine this in advance.

    ![Pokemon Go Cooldown Chart](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-joystick-10.jpg)

## Part 2. Why is Pokemon Go Routes Not Showing Up?

As previously mentioned, the root causes of the Pokemon Go Routes glitch vary from one trainer to another. It’s possible that the Pokemon Go Routes are not showing up because your Trainer Level is not high enough. Yes. This option is only available to players who reach the required level.

![pokemon go route missing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-4.JPG)

### There are no recorded Routes near your location

It’s possible that the Pokemon Routes are not showing up because you’re too far from them. Try to move around and see if the walking paths will finally appear on your radar. In this case, all you need to do is find the perfect spot where Routes are recorded.

### Your internet connection is unstable while playing Pokemon Go

Pokemon Go Routes and most of the game’s main features require a reliable internet connection. If you’re connected to slow and unstable internet access, the Pokemon Go app will not load up properly. That’s probably the reason why Pokemon Go Routes are not completing or working at all on your end.
