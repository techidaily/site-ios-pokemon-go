## Where Is the Best Place to Catch Dratini On Apple iPhone 12 Pro

Dratini is a rare Pokemon that can be found in the wild. It is a Dragon-type Pokemon that evolves into Dragonair and then into Dragonite. Dratini is a popular Pokemon among players due to its rarity and powerful evolution. If you are looking to catch Dratini on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro, you may be wondering where the best place to find them is.

Dratini is one of the Pokémon creatures that resemble a snake. It has an elongated blue body with a blue white underside. It carries three-pronged fins on each side of its head which are white in color. Dratini also has a white bump on the forehead.

Dratini has an energy level that is constantly increasing, which makes it grow and can reach a length of more than 6 feet. It sheds its skin every time it has to grow, and usually hide behind a waterfall when shedding. The colony of Dratini lives underwater, living at the bottom feeding on food that falls from the upper levels. Outrage is the signature move for this Pokémon creature.

## Part 1: What’s the evolution of Dratini?

Dratini undergoes two different evolutions

The first un-evolved version is the serpentine Dratini that looks like a snake and continues shedding its skin as it grows. When you get to level 30, Dratini evolves into Dragonair, and at level 55 it becomes Dragonite

### Dragonair

This is an evolution of Dratini, which has a long scaly serpent-like body. It still retails the blue body with a white underside. The white bump on the forehead now becomes a white horn. The budding wings on the side of the head have now grown into full wings. It also carries three crystal orbs, with one on the neck and the other two on the tail.

Dragonair has the ability to stretch its wings so it can fly. It has a huge amount of energy in the body and can discharge the energy through the crystals. The energy that it releases has the ability to change the weather wherever it is. Dragonair can be found in seas and lakes.

### Dragonite

This is a Pokémon character that truly resembles a dragon and is the second evolution of Dratini. It has a yellow thick body, and a couple of antennae that come out of its forehead. It has a striated underbelly. The body is quite large when compared to the small wings.

Dragonite can fly at very high speeds despite its bulky appearance. It is a kindhearted Pokémon, which is as intelligent as a human being. It has been found to have tendencies to save humans from disasters, such as saving those who have come from a capsized ship on the high seas. It lives near the sea and is extremely rare in the Pokémon world.

## Part 2: Where can I find the Dratini nest?

Dratini is a Pokémon that lives in the water. Since it loves lakes and seas, you can find it when you visit areas that are near water. For example, in the United States, the most famous nests for Dratini are found in North Eastern San Francisco, Pier 39 and Pier 15. You will always find Dratini at these sites and they are famous for people who want to farm Dratini.

You may also g West to Squirtle Nest where you can get a lot of Dratini.

Dratini has a 5% spawning chance every day, so if you have the time, you can spend it on these sites as you enjoy the watery view and wait for it to appear.

Dratini nests can also be found in other parts of the world, such as Tokyo, Japan; Sydney and New South Wales, Australia; Paris, France and others.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 3: Are the Dratini nest and spawn spot in the same place?

This is quite a common question for those who are new to the Pokémon universe. Basically, Dratini nests and spawn points are the same for a period of two weeks. The nests then migrate leaving the spawn points to spawn different types of Pokémon.

If the Dratini nest migrates, it can still come back in the future. You should always keep an eye at the spawn point where you first encountered your first Dratini Nest; it may come back once more and you can continue farming Dratini.

Dratini nests will migrate on alternate Thursdays at midnight. The nest migrations are random, so make sure that you visit and hit them many times over the two weeks in order to get the most Dratini that you can.

## Part 4: How to increase the possibility of earning Pokémon Go Dratini?

As mentioned earlier, Dratini can be found in certain places around the world. If you live outside these regions, you cannot be able to get Dratini. The best way to go about getting Dratini in such cases is to virtually relocate your device. This means that you can take your device to Tokyo nest sites even if you live in Africa.

The best app to use for teleportation is [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

**Features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)**

- Instantly teleport to an area where a Dratini nest has been found and remotely collect as many as you can.
- Use the joystick feature to move around the map until you come across Dratini.
- The app allows you to seem to be walking, riding a bike, or in a vehicle, on the map. This simulates real-time travel data, which is important when playing Pokémon Go.
- Any app that relies on geo-location data can safely use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for teleportation.

**A step-by-step guide to spoof your location using Dr.Fone Virtual Location (iOS)**

On the official Dr.Fone page, download and install Dr.Fone on your computer or you can click the Download button below to download it directly. Launch it and then go to the Home screen and click on “Virtual Location”.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Once you have successfully teleported your device, you will be able to navigate to the area where the Dratini nest has been found. You can use the joystick feature for this. You should also click on “Move here” so your location is permanently moved to that place.

You may now camp and keep hitting the Dratini nest so you can farm as many as possible within the two weeks before the nest migrates to another location.

Camping and looking for other Pokémon in the area will help you cool down and therefore avoid being banned from the game for spoofing your iOS device.
