## Part 3: 3 Ways to fix Pokémon GPS not working on Android devices

The android devices might also get into an issue that is under discussion. To make sure that the problem is fixed it is advised to follow the 3 most important ways that are discussed in this section.

### Method 1: Turn on Location Services

### Method 3: Update the Application

This is another important aspect. There are auto-updates disabled by some users and this can lead to a problem if the application is not updated. To avoid this scenario it is advised not to update just the Pokémon Go app but every application to overcome the issue in full. Just visit Play store > my apps and games > update all.
