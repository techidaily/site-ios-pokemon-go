## Part 1: What’s the Need for a Pokemon Go Joystick?

If you are an avid Pokemon Go player, then you might already know that the game demands us to step outside to catch Pokemons or participate in raids. Sadly, not everyone can travel so much on their own. Therefore, you might consider using a Pokemon Go joystick on iOS/Android under the following circumstances.

- In the current Covid-19 pandemic, you might be under a lockdown and can’t step out.
- You could have already explored your nearby areas and would like to catch more Pokemons.
- There could be any other health or environmental condition, stopping you from going out.
- The weather outside might not be suitable or safe to explore the Pokemon Go map on your own.
- Any other possible reason for not being able to travel solely or having enough time to catch Pokemons.

## Part 2: Possible Risks for Using a Pokemon Go Joystick

A Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution can easily change your present location in the game or even simulate your movement. Though, if you use the Pokemon Go joystick app multiple times a day and Niantic detects it, then it can cause some issues.

Please note that the use of any location spoofing or Pokemon Go hack (joystick) is against the terms of Niantic. Therefore, if your account is found using these hacks, then Niantic can display warning messages. If after getting multiple warnings, the hack is still being detected, then it can lead to a temporary or even a permanent ban of your account.

## Part 3: Why you Should Look for iPogo Alternatives?

Even though iPogo would let you access all kinds of Pokemon Go hacks, it has numerous pitfalls. Here are some of the reasons that would make you look for a better iPogo alternative instead.

- As of now, iPogo is only available for iOS devices and not Android. If you are looking for an iPogo Android alternative, then you can try [PGSharp](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-effective-pgsharp-spoof-pokemon-go.html) as well.
- Ideally, iPogo for Pokemon Go is against the terms and conditions of Niantic and its constant use can cause a permanent ban on your account.
- Since the installation process for the iPogo iOS app is a bit complicated, it would need prior technical experience.
- Please note that iPogo is not a reliable service and it can stop working anytime (like [iSpoofer](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-shut-down.html)). This can cause a sudden loss of your money and progress in Pokemon Go.

**Step 3: Simulate your Apple iPhone 6s’s movement between multiple spots**

Apart from that, you can also simulate the movement of your device by selecting the One-stop or Multi-stop modes from the top. This will let you drop the pins on the map to create a route for Pokemon Go.

![virtual location 06](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

Furthermore, you can enter the number of times to cover the route and even select a preferred speed for the movement. Once you click on the “March” button, the simulation of the movement would be started. You can also access a GPS joystick at the bottom to move realistically on the map in any direction.

## Conclusion

I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to know more about iPogo for Pokemon Go and its use. Since the iPogo iOS app would need jailbreak access on your device, you can consider using an alternative. I would recommend using [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) as it is a user-friendly solution that won’t need jailbreak access on your device. Besides spoofing your location on Pokemon Go, it can also simulate your device’s movement at a preferred speed and offers tons of features to [level up in Pokemon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/pokemon-go/how-to-level-up-fast-in-pokemon-go.html), and other games.



## iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Apple iPhone 6s?

If you are a sincere Pokemon Go player who sticks by the rules and plays the game, then you probably don’t know how hard it is to eliminate a location spoofer from the picture. The game attains new spheres and seems more interesting with a location spoofer involved. If you are an iOS user or an Android enthusiast who is eager for iSpoofer’s return or worried about iSpoofer Pogo not working, then this might just be the right article for you.

## Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?

iSpoofer was discontinued two years ago, around 2019 and still remains out of action. This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application. The main target customers for iSpoofer were the PoGo players and having them gone, there is not much the app can offer.

![iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1.jpg)

The initial version remains unsupportive and shows ‘Maintenance’ pop up while you cannot download any new versions from their website. It still contains the old links on the site which are of no use to the current players. Tackling with too much will also result in account ban as Pokemon Go has strict rules that no third party applications will be entertained.

Since we haven’t heard from iSpoofer in 2020, we can assume that they won’t be here for long and it would be a wise choice to look for alternatives.

## Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer

It is hard to handle change especially when you are an iPhone user. There aren’t many apps that you can find on the App Store and you never know their authenticity. Even if you find a good location spoofer, you never know how long that is going to keep your location changed or if it will remain undetected. That being said - your first obvious option for spoofing Pokemon Go would be -

### Any App from the Apple App Store

If the iSpoofer for Pogo is not working, then you can make a simple search for some other GPS location changer on the App store and they would help you for a short time. If you are lucky then they might remain undetected for a very long time. However, we won’t suggest this to be the most stable option so we can move ahead to the next best thing for the iOS users.

### In-built spoofing with VPNs

Virtual Private Networks are known for masking your IP on the world wide web but what most of you don’t know is that they can also spoof your location. But this is only restricted to a few VPN applications that have the feature. SurfShark and ExpressVPn are two of the most affordable and efficient VPNs that you can consider for your iOS devices.

The spoofer will help you play Pokemon Go for sure though I cannot give you assurance about other games in the market. However, the detection rate is a problem because Pokemon Go is capable of detecting these VPNs and blocking your account if you don’t play your cards well. That is, you need to be careful about where you are ‘changing’ your location to (not too far).

If you are looking for something long lasting and something that won’t pose a detection problem, then I would suggest you to go for WOnder share’s Dr.Fone. It is affordable, has some remarkable features and works great for both Android and iOS devices.

Unlike iSpoofer, this will not require jailbreak access, detects every location on the globe and poses no threat to your Pokemon Go account.

## Part 3 - Tips to avoid being Banned

- You need to give enough time for the cool down. This means, as soon as you change your location, wait for a few minutes before you can play the game again so that the ‘vigilante’ does not catch this abrupt change.
- Try not to use apps that are too amateur, having fake reviews on Google/App stores because these will be too vulnerable and detectable.
- If you are not sure where to spoof, then there are certain safe co-ordinates that lon term gamers of Pokemon Go suggest so you can opt for them. They are just for starters until you find your way through
- Try not to make abrupt location changes - keep it nearby initially and slowly try to increase your radius. An abrupt change can draw attention.
