Now there is another way of capturing Meltan, that is, by opening a mystery box.

The Mystery Box will act as an essence precisely for Meltan, attracting a large amount of the small Hex Nut Pok√©mon to your locality for one hour. It takes time to recharge, about three days, but after it is charged, you have to transfer another Pok√©mon to HOME to be able to use it again for an hour. If you get to use the Mystery Box in the course of specific events, you can even grab a Shiny Meltan.

When specific Pok√©mon holds the right Mega Stone, they can do temporary Mega Evolutions in the battle. The Mega Evolutions provide the Pok√©mon massive stat boost and new capabilities.

Below is the step-by-step guide to help you learn how to evolve into Shiny Mega Mewtwo-

**Step 1:** You have to do some work before getting access to Mega Evolutions. Performing and finishing these tasks will help you get the item you require to perform Mega Evolutions. Acquire the Rumble Badge from Shalour Gym through defeating Korrina.

**Step 2:** Go to the peak of the Tower of Mystery after the fight and talk to Korrina to get the Mega Ring.

**Step 3:** Now, it‚Äôs time to upgrade the Mega Ring. Well, the upgraded ring isn‚Äôt essential for all Mega Evolutions but is needed to locate the hidden Mega Stones. Professor Sycamore is going to upgrade your Mega Ring at the Anistar Sundial after defeating your opponent in Kiloude City. It‚Äôs not possible after you complete the main story.

**Step 4:** In order to perform a Mega Evolution, the Pok√©mon needs to hold a special Mega Stone. These Mega Stones are unique to each Pok√©mon. Only some Pok√©mon can Mega Evolve with them and Mewtwo is one of them. For Mewtwo, the location of Mega Stones is Unknown Dungeon.

**Step 5:** Give the Mega Stone to that corresponding Pok√©mon for holding as it is required for Pok√©mon to hold its Mega Stone in order to perform Mega Evolution.

**Step 6:** You can perform Mega Evolution in battles and only one of your Pok√©mon can perform Mega Evolution per battle. Your Pok√©mon will remain in its Mega form until the fight is complete or it faints.

That‚Äôs how to evolve into Mega Mewtwo. As you can now see that the first and most important step is to beat Korrina in order to mega evolve.

## The Bottom Line

That‚Äôs all on Mewtwo Mega Evolution. Yes, Mega Mewtwo is the strongest Pok√©mon. To perform its Mega Evolution, it must hold its own special Mega Stone - Mewtwonite X or Mewtwonite Y. Trainers have to wear a bracelet called Mega Ring and it can be acquired at the Tower of Mastery in Shalour City, but you need to defeat the Gym Leader for that. With both things accessible, you can select the Mega Evolution option with an attack. Keep in mind that only one Pok√©mon per trainer is capable of Mega Evolving during each battle. Once a Pok√©mon is in its Mega form, it remains in that form until the battle completes.
