## iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Apple iPhone 12 mini?

If you are a sincere Pokemon Go player who sticks by the rules and plays the game, then you probably don’t know how hard it is to eliminate a location spoofer from the picture. The game attains new spheres and seems more interesting with a location spoofer involved. If you are an iOS user or an Android enthusiast who is eager for iSpoofer’s return or worried about iSpoofer Pogo not working, then this might just be the right article for you.

## Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?

iSpoofer was discontinued two years ago, around 2019 and still remains out of action. This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application. The main target customers for iSpoofer were the PoGo players and having them gone, there is not much the app can offer.

![iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1.jpg)

The initial version remains unsupportive and shows ‘Maintenance’ pop up while you cannot download any new versions from their website. It still contains the old links on the site which are of no use to the current players. Tackling with too much will also result in account ban as Pokemon Go has strict rules that no third party applications will be entertained.

Since we haven’t heard from iSpoofer in 2020, we can assume that they won’t be here for long and it would be a wise choice to look for alternatives.

## Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer

![iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2.jpg)

It is hard to handle change especially when you are an iPhone user. There aren’t many apps that you can find on the App Store and you never know their authenticity. Even if you find a good location spoofer, you never know how long that is going to keep your location changed or if it will remain undetected. That being said - your first obvious option for spoofing Pokemon Go would be -

### Any App from the Apple App Store

If the iSpoofer for Pogo is not working, then you can make a simple search for some other GPS location changer on the App store and they would help you for a short time. If you are lucky then they might remain undetected for a very long time. However, we won’t suggest this to be the most stable option so we can move ahead to the next best thing for the iOS users.

![iOS-App-Store-pic-3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iOS-App-Store-pic-3.jpg)

### In-built spoofing with VPNs

Virtual Private Networks are known for masking your IP on the world wide web but what most of you don’t know is that they can also spoof your location. But this is only restricted to a few VPN applications that have the feature. SurfShark and ExpressVPn are two of the most affordable and efficient VPNs that you can consider for your iOS devices.

The spoofer will help you play Pokemon Go for sure though I cannot give you assurance about other games in the market. However, the detection rate is a problem because Pokemon Go is capable of detecting these VPNs and blocking your account if you don’t play your cards well. That is, you need to be careful about where you are ‘changing’ your location to (not too far).

![VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4.jpg)

If you are looking for something long lasting and something that won’t pose a detection problem, then I would suggest you to go for WOnder share’s Dr.Fone. It is affordable, has some remarkable features and works great for both Android and iOS devices.

Unlike iSpoofer, this will not require jailbreak access, detects every location on the globe and poses no threat to your Pokemon Go account. Here are the simple steps that you need to follow to work with [Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html) for spoofing location

Pokemon go has been around for a while now and has arisen as one of the most talked-about games in the gaming community. The fact that it is a location-based game and needs you to move around while playing the game makes it further interesting. Trading in Pokemon go is one of the most talked-about features. Today, we will help you explore more about stardust trade costs and how can you easily perform trades! Hang on as we dwell deeper into Pokemon go and trade stardust costs.

## Part 1: How does Pokemon trading work?

So as we've discussed earlier, Pokemon go trading is one of the most interesting features of the game. So how does this trading work? In Pokemon Go, you can trade pokemon possessed by you with those possessed by your friends if both you and your friend, decide to mutually trade the pokemon with each other! For trading in Pokemon go, there are certain criteria you need to satisfy to qualify for trading in Pokemon go! Given below are the requirements to qualify for trading in Pokemon go

- Be at least level 10
- Be friends with the person you're trading on Pokemon go
- Be in a radius of 100 m while you're trading

However, Pokemon go also has levels of friendship and you can trade pokemon of different levels with friends with whom you have different friendship levels. Higher is the friendship level, higher is the level of Pokemon which you can trade. every trade requires you and your partner to spend stardust points. So There are basically 4 levels of friendship in Pokemon go

- Friend
- Good friend
- Ultra friend
- Best friend

The levels of your friendship with a player on Pokemon go increase with the increase in the number of days you stay friends with them. Within a month of friendship, you can become best friends with a player on Pokemon go! You also need stardust points on Pokemon go. So what is stardust trade cost? Before you trade any pokemon you must spend stardust coins. Not having enough stardust trade coins will not allow the trade of pokemon to happen. Hence, you must have enough stardust trade costs.

## Part 2: How much stardust do you need in pokemon trading costs?

Trading in Pokemon go is quite complex. This is because the needed Stardust points will be different in every case and will depend on several factors. Factors such as whether you already half got that Pokemon in your pokedesk or not, the friendship level of you and your friend who are interested in trading, or whether the Pokemon is rare or common. Given below are the Stardust trade costs for each Pokemon.

**Standard trades**

- Good friend:100
- Great friends:80
- Ultra Friends: 8
- Best friend: 4

**Shiny or legendary (caught by you)**

- Good Friend: 20,000
- Great Friend: 16,000
- Ultra Friend: 1,600
- Best Friend: 800

**Shiny or Legendary (not caught by you)**

- Good Friend: 1,000,000
- Great Friend: 800,000
- Ultra Friend: 80,000
- Best Friend: 40,000

However, this Stardust trade cost may vary according to the friendship levels! Before trading, you must think of the friendship level between you and your friend and also if the Pokemon which has been traded can be evolved through trading. Evolving Pokemon through trading is another beneficial tactic that could benefit you as a player of Pokemon go.

## Here’s Everything You Should Know About Pokemon Stops in Detail On Apple iPhone 12 mini

If you are just starting with Pokemon Go, then you might see Pokemon stops all around you! Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.

![Pokemon Go Stops Guide](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?

In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.

Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.

![Exploring Pokemon Go Stops](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg)

## Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?

Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.

These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.

****Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store****

Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.

![Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg)

****Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go****

Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.

![Add Pokestop Lure Module](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg)

That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.

![Lure Module Installed on Pokestop](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg)

For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.

## Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?

With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.

****Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby****

You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.

In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.

****Use Lure Modules with Friends****

Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you/your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.

## Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?

While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone 12 mini’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:

****Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone 12 mini and Launch the Application****

At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone 12 mini to the system using a working cable and trust the system. On the interface of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), just agree to its terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

****Step 2: Enter the Details of the Target Location****

Once your Apple iPhone 12 mini is detected by the interface, its present location would be displayed with other details. To spoof the location of your Apple iPhone 12 mini on Pokemon Go, you can click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Now, you can go to the search options on the top-left side and enter the address or exact coordinates of the Pokestop. You can find the location of a Pokestop from several freely available online sources.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

****Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone 12 mini Location to a Pokemon stop****

As you would enter the location, the interface will automatically change to the designated spot. You can now move the pin around on the map and even zoom in/out to drop it at the exact spot. In the end, just click on the “Move Here” button to spoof your Apple iPhone 12 mini’s location and visit the Pokemon stop virtually.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

Besides that, you can also use the one-stop or multi-stop modes of the application to simulate your movement and visit the nearby Pokemon Go stops.

I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to know about Poke stops in Pokemon Go. I have included several tips that I implement to find Pokemon stops near me in this guide. Though, if you want to catch more Pokemons via Pokemon Go stops, then you can simply use Lure Modules. Apart from that, you can also use a dedicated location spoofer like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) to visit Pokemon stops anywhere in the world and replenish unlimited items without any trouble.
