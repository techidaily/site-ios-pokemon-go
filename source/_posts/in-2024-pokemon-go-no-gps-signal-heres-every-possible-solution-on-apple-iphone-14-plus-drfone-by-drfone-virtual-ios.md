- Your phone might not be connected to an active internet connection.
- Pokemon Go could not have permission to access the location of your device.

## Part 2: How to Fix Pokemon Go No GPS Signal Issue on iOS Devices?

If you own an iOS device and are facing the Pokemon Go GPS bug, then you can follow these troubleshooting tips.

### Fix 1: Enable the Location Services on your Phone

Before taking any drastic measures, make sure that the location services on your iOS device are enabled. You can just go to the Control Center and tap on the GPS icon to turn it on. Alternatively, you can also browse to its Settings > Privacy > Location Services and toggle on this feature.

![enable location services iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/enable-location-services-iphone.jpg)

After that, you can restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS Pokemon Go issue or not.

### Fix 2: Grant the Pokemon Go app Location Access

Turning on the location services on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus is not enough and you need to grant the GPS access to the Pokemon Go app. To fix the Pokemon Go GPS problem on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, simply visit its Settings > Privacy > Location Services. Now, from the list of the installed apps, select Pokemon Go and make sure it can access the GPS on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus while running (or always).

### Fix 3: Set Precise Location for Pokemon Go

In case the Pokemon Go GPS is not accurate on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, then you can enable the “Precise Location” option for the app. This will make sure that Pokemon Go can access the exact location of your phone.

To fix these Pokemon Go GPS issues, you can go to your phone’s Settings > Privacy > Location Services and select Pokemon Go. From the location sharing option, make sure the Precise Location feature is enabled.

### Fix 4: Step Into an Open Area

If you're currently in an area with poor GPS reception due to buildings or trees, try moving to an open area with a clear view of the sky. This can significantly improve your GPS signal strength.

### Fix 5: Restart the App and the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device

Lastly, you can just reload the Pokemon Go app or restart your Apple iPhone 14 Plus if you still get the Pokemon Go no GPS signal. You can just go to the app drawer and swipe up the Pokemon Go card to close the app.

On top of that, Pokemon Go Routes can also be of great help if you’re searching for new walking paths around your location.

In this article, we will discuss how Pokemon Go Routes basically work. We will also talk about the main reasons why **Pokemon Go Routes is not showing up** sometimes. Lastly, we will provide some helpful tips to fix this kind of problem. Continue reading below to learn more.

## Part 1. How Do Routes in Pokemon Go Work?

The logic behind the Pokemon Go Routes is very simple. There are only two things you need to remember about it. First, you can record a walking path anywhere and submit it for review. Your Route will immediately appear on the Pokemon Go map once it receives approval from the game developer. Of course, the quality and safety of the Route must be checked thoroughly before it becomes available to the public. Another thing about the Route is that you can use it to discover and explore new walking paths near you. All you need to do is pick your preferred Route and finish the entire trail. Afterward, you can obtain special rewards and extra bonus points upon its completion.

Do you want to try Pokemon Go Routes now? Here’s a quick guide for you on how to access it on your mobile device.

- **Step 1:** Launch the Pokemon Go application on your smartphone.
- **Step 2:** On the map view, find and click the **Nearby** icon at the bottom-right corner of your screen.

![nearby option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-1.jpg)

![pokemon go route](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-2.jpg)

- **Step 4:** From there, decide if you wish to discover nearby Routes or create your own.

**NOTE:** The Create New Route feature is only available to selected Pokemon Go players. If Pokemon Go Routes is not showing up on your end, it’s probably because you’re not yet eligible.

## Part 2. Why is Pokemon Go Routes Not Showing Up?

As previously mentioned, the root causes of the Pokemon Go Routes glitch vary from one trainer to another. It’s possible that the Pokemon Go Routes are not showing up because your Trainer Level is not high enough. Yes. This option is only available to players who reach the required level. However, the player’s respective rank is not always the culprit for this issue. There are other factors that might also result in the same problem. Check out the list below to understand it better.

![pokemon go route missing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-4.JPG)

### There are no recorded Routes near your location

It’s possible that the Pokemon Routes are not showing up because you’re too far from them. Try to move around and see if the walking paths will finally appear on your radar. In this case, all you need to do is find the perfect spot where Routes are recorded.

### The Pokemon Go application has no adequate location access on your smartphone

![pokemon go location access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-5.JPG)

Is Pokemon Go Route not working on your end? Well, it’s possibly because the application has limited or restricted access to GPS on your smartphone. Don’t worry. It’s nothing serious. You can easily fix this kind of misconfiguration by adjusting your privacy settings.

### Your internet connection is unstable while playing Pokemon Go

Pokemon Go Routes and most of the game’s main features require a reliable internet connection. If you’re connected to slow and unstable internet access, the Pokemon Go app will not load up properly. That’s probably the reason why Pokemon Go Routes are not completing or working at all on your end.

### The current software version of your smartphone is not compatible with the Pokemon Go Routes feature

Android 6.0 and iOS 14 or higher are the main system requirements of the Pokemon Go application.
