 As I read this query posted by a Pokémon Go player on Reddit, I realized that a lot of people can encounter this issue. Since getting a 100 IV Pokémon is something that every player wants, I decided to come up with this guide. In this post, I will share some smart tricks that would help you catch a 100 IV Pokémon. Besides that, I will also let you know how to make the most of a **100 IV Pokémon Go map** as well.

_**Tips:** Are you finding the 100 IV Pokémon Go map? Discover the ultimate solution with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, your key to pinpointing and capturing those coveted 100 IV Pokémon! Try it now and unlock endless possibilities!_

## Part 1: What Does 100 IV Mean in Pokémon Go?

IV stands for Individual Value, which depicts the overall performance of any Pokémon in the game. You can say that it is a kind of rank of Pokémon in the game. Ideally, not all Pokémon of the same species have the exact efficiencies. Any Pokémon in the game is measured by three tactics – attack, defense, and stamina. A value from 0 to 15 is allocated for all these parameters. A Pokémon with 15/15/15 perfect stats would get a 100 Individual Value.

- A Pokémon with 45/45 stats is known as a 100 IV Pokémon, as it can reach the maximum CP for its species.
- These Pokémon have a higher HP, base stats, and combat value, and just perform better than other Pokémon of lower IV.

Now, as you know what 100 IV means, we are sure that you want to catch the Pokémon with 100 IV on the map. But, for catching Pokémon 100 IV, you either need patience or wait for days, or you can do it with spoofing.

Yes, you read it right! With [Pokemon Go spoofing](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html), you can catch powerful characters in less time.

![Pokemon Go 100 IV Map introduction](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-1.jpg)

In the following parts, we will discuss in detail the possible ways to catch Pokémon Go IV 100 on the map, including location spoofer.

Keeping reading!

## Part 2: How to Check the IVs of Pokémon?

Before you put effort into catching the Pokémon IV 100 map, you should have knowledge about which Pokémon has a stat of 100 IV. Following are the ways with which you can check the IVs of Pokémon in the Pokémon Go game.

### 2.1 Check IVs within the app

You can check the true percentages of your characters’ IVs in the gaming app itself. Now, if you use the appraisal system of the app, your team leader will show the stats of each Pokémon and can give it a star rating as well.

Further, you can also click on the arrows on the left and right to see the stats of the next Pokémon.

### 2.2 Know Pokémon IV using search filters

![know pokemon iv](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-2.jpg)

Pokémon Go app has a search feature that you can use to know the exact IV of Pokémon. To do this, tap the search icon present at the top of your Pokémon menu. Now in the search bar, type the name of any Pokémon, say type “shiny”. This will show all the shiny mons with different star ratings.

Now check the Pokémon by their star rating, as this is the easy way to know about the IVs of characters. Type “4\*” in the search bar, and you will see characters with a 4-star rating. Mostly a star Pokémon are a 100 IV Pokémon map.

## Part 3: Tips to Catch 100 IV Pokémon in the Game

Since 100 IV Pokémon are so sought-after, catching them can be a tough job. Apart from using a **Pokémon Go 100 IV map**, here are other tips that can increase your chances to catch the perfect IVs Pokémon to some extent. A Weather Boosted wild catch can increase your odds to a 1 in 1,725 chance. But, this is still not so easy for a player.

![catch 100 iv pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-3.jpg)

- If you are fortunate, then you can end up [catching a “lucky” Pokémon](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html). Though, the chances of a lucky Pokémon having 100 IV are 1 in 64 presently.
- Although you get only one chance in 4,096 chances to catch the high-rank character in Pokemon Go and the probability of finding perfect IVs is 0.0244% from a wild catch, you can do some research to improve your chances.
- Catching a Pokémon from a quest, hatching it from an egg, or catching it by defending a raid might also result in a 100 IV Pokémon (1 in 216 chances).
- Trading increases the chances of perfect IVs.

Trading is one way to improve the chances of catching the 100 IV Pokémon Go map. Trading Pokémon between friends can increase the odds of finding perfect IVs. Moreover, it is a great way to boost IVs, as well. The odds depend on your level of friendship.

![trading increases the chance of perfect ivs](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-4.jpg)

- For example, with good friend trade, the chances are 1 in 3,375
- With great friend trade, the chances are 1 in 2,744
- When you make a trade with ultra-friend, the chances are 1 in 2,197
- Last, doing trade with a best friend creates chances to catch perfect IV 1 in 1,331

But, again, trading Pokémon is not very helpful. If you only rely on trading, you may have to wait for a long time for perfect IVs.

## Part 1: What’s the Need for a Pokemon Go Joystick?

If you are an avid Pokemon Go player, then you might already know that the game demands us to step outside to catch Pokemons or participate in raids. Sadly, not everyone can travel so much on their own. Therefore, you might consider using a Pokemon Go joystick on iOS/Android under the following circumstances.

- In the current Covid-19 pandemic, you might be under a lockdown and can’t step out.
- You could have already explored your nearby areas and would like to catch more Pokemons.
- There could be any other health or environmental condition, stopping you from going out.
- The weather outside might not be suitable or safe to explore the Pokemon Go map on your own.
- Any other possible reason for not being able to travel solely or having enough time to catch Pokemons.

## Part 2: Possible Risks for Using a Pokemon Go Joystick

A Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution can easily change your present location in the game or even simulate your movement. Though, if you use the Pokemon Go joystick app multiple times a day and Niantic detects it, then it can cause some issues.

Please note that the use of any location spoofing or Pokemon Go hack (joystick) is against the terms of Niantic. Therefore, if your account is found using these hacks, then Niantic can display warning messages. If after getting multiple warnings, the hack is still being detected, then it can lead to a temporary or even a permanent ban of your account.

- Try not to overly use the Pokemon Go joystick app all the time. It is recommended to use these apps 2-3 times a day only.
- Always consider the cooldown duration in mind before changing your location. For instance, avoid using the app for a while before moving from one place to another. If you move from London to Tokyo to New York the same day, then your account might get flagged.
- Try to spoof your location in the same district or state first and wait for a few hours before changing your whereabouts. The following cooldown duration chart would help you determine this in advance.

    ![Pokemon Go Cooldown Chart](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-joystick-10.jpg)

## Here’s Everything You Should Know About Pokemon Stops in Detail On Apple iPhone SE (2020)

If you are just starting with Pokemon Go, then you might see Pokemon stops all around you! Well, Pokemon Go stops are extremely essential in the game as they would help you collect items or even catch Pokemons. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to find Pokemon Go stops near me and would also discuss a solution to explore Pokemon stops in any other place.

![Pokemon Go Stops Guide](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What are Pokemon Stops in Pokemon Go?

In nutshell, Pokemon Go stops are dedicated places in the Pokemon Go map that can be visited to collect valuable items. For instance, you can obtain eggs, Poke balls, potions, and other game-related items from a Pokemon Go stop near you. At times, even a Pokemon can be found roaming nearby a Pokemon Go stop.

Mostly, Pokemon stops are located at important buildings, monuments, art installations, and other vital areas. On your map, you can see Pokemon stops near me depicted by a blue triangle icon. As you would approach the Pokemon stop, it will change to a disc icon and you can obtain various features by tapping on it in the game.

![Exploring Pokemon Go Stops](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-2.jpg)

## Part 2: How to use Lure Modules on Poke Stops in Pokemon Go?

Lure Module is a beneficial in-game item in Pokemon Go that can lure the nearby Pokemons to a Poke stop. Ideally, you can place a Lure Module at any Poke stop in Pokemon Go and it will be helpful to other players as well. As of now, the effect of a single Lure Module will last for 30 minutes, but you can install another module to prolong its effect.

These days, a lot of brands and businesses also place Lure Modules to create Pokemon Go sponsored stops that would attract players to a designated location. Here’s how I installed a Lure Module at Pokemon Go stops near me.

****Step 1: Buy Lure Modules from the Pokemon Go Store****

Before you install a Lure Module to a Pokemon stop, you need to purchase it on your account. For this, just launch Pokemon Go, tap on the Pokeball icon, and visit the “Items” store. From here, you can look for Lure Module and purchase any number of modules.

![Buy Lure Module Pokemon Go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-3.jpg)

****Step 2: Set up Lure Modules at Pokestops in Pokemon Go****

Great! Once you have purchased Lure Modules, just step out and find Pokemon stops near me. After finding the Pokemon stop of your choice, tap on the disc icon to get more options. Now, tap on the Lure Module slot icon (white bar) at the top and go to the Pokemon Module feature.

![Add Pokestop Lure Module](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-4.jpg)

That’s it! You can now select Lure Module from the Pokemon Module options and simply place it at the designated Pokemon stop. The Pokemon Go stop’s icon would change with rose petals to attract the nearby Pokemons.

![Lure Module Installed on Pokestop](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/everything-about-pokemon-stops-5.jpg)

For the next 30 minutes, the nearby Pokemons will automatically come to the designated Pokemon Go stop. This will benefit you and any other trainer who would visit the Pokemon Go stop until the allocated time.

## Part 3: How Can You Make Pokestops into Farming Spots in the Game?

With the help of Lure Modules and other techniques, players can make Pokemon Go stops into farming spots to catch more Pokemons. Ideally, you can also apply these suggestions that I followed to enhance Pokemon Go stops near me.

****Explore Multiple Pokemon Go Stops nearby****

You might already know that trainers with Level 38 or above can nominate places to become Pokemon Go stops. Therefore, you and your friends can also help create multiple Poke stops in Pokemon Go nearby.

In this way, you can simply explore multiple Pokemon Go stops by walking. In a single walk, this would let you replenish items in Pokemon Go and you might end up catching more Pokemons as well.

****Use Lure Modules with Friends****

Instead of solely using Lure Modules, you can go with your friends to catch Pokemons. For instance, you and your friends can install Lure Modules at the nearby Pokemon Go stops. This will automatically create a farming spot for that place, attracting all kinds of nearby Pokemons. Not only would this benefit you/your friends, but let other trainers to catch tons of new Pokemons easily.

## Part 4: How to Explore Pokemon Go Stops Remotely (without Walking)?

While Pokemon Go is all about exploring and going out to find Pokemon and Pokestops, not everyone can step out or walk so much. In this case, you can use a dedicated tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) that can spoof your Apple iPhone SE (2020)’s location to anywhere you want. You can simply change your location to any other spot where a Pokemon stop is located or even simulate your movement in the following way:

****Step 1: Connect your Apple iPhone SE (2020) and Launch the Application****

At first, just install the application, launch the Dr.Fone toolkit on your PC, and click on the “Virtual Location” module from its home.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Subsequently, also connect your Apple iPhone SE (2020) to the system using a working cable and trust the system. On the interface of Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), just agree to its terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

****Step 2: Enter the Details of the Target Location****

Once your Apple iPhone SE (2020) is detected by the interface, its present location would be displayed with other details. To spoof the location of your Apple iPhone SE (2020) on Pokemon Go, you can click on the Teleport Mode icon from the top.

![launch the Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Now, you can go to the search options on the top-left side and enter the address or exact coordinates of the Pokestop. You can find the location of a Pokestop from several freely available online sources.

****Step 3: Spoof your Apple iPhone SE (2020) Location to a Pokemon stop****

As you would enter the location, the interface will automatically change to the designated spot. You can now move the pin around on the map and even zoom in/out to drop it at the exact spot. In the end, just click on the “Move Here” button to spoof your Apple iPhone SE (2020)’s location and visit the Pokemon stop virtually.

Besides that, you can also use the one-stop or multi-stop modes of the application to simulate your movement and visit the nearby Pokemon Go stops.

I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to know about Poke stops in Pokemon Go. I have included several tips that I implement to find Pokemon stops near me in this guide. Though, if you want to catch more Pokemons via Pokemon Go stops, then you can simply use Lure Modules. Apart from that, you can also use a dedicated location spoofer like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) to visit Pokemon stops anywhere in the world and replenish unlimited items without any trouble.
