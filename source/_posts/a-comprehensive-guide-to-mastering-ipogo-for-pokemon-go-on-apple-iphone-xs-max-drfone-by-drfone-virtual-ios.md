- To install iPogo on your iOS device, you must have to jailbreak your Apple iPhone XS Max (it doesn’t support standard devices).
- The iPogo iOS app can spoof your Apple iPhone XS Max location to anywhere you like and reflect it on Pokemon Go.
- There is also a provision to simulate the Apple iPhone XS Max device movement of your Apple iPhone XS Max on Pokemon Go.
- Other features of the iPogo iOS app are feeds for raids and quests, enhanced throws, fast catch, and more.

![iPogo iOS App](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/2021/guide-for-ipogo-1.jpg)

**Price**: The basic version of iPogo is available for free that would let you teleport your location in Pokemon Go. To access more features of iPogo for Pokemon Go, you can get its premium subscription for $4.99 per month.

## Part 2: How to Use iPogo to Improve your Pokemon Go Gameplay?

If you also want to use the iPogo iOS app, then you first need to jailbreak your Apple iPhone XS Max. Also, since the use of iPogo for Pokemon Go can lead to an account ban, you can consider creating a new account before using it. Here’s how you can use the iPogo iOS app to spoof location on Pokemon Go.

**Step 1: Download and Install the iPogo iOS app**

At first, you can just jailbreak your device by using any freely available resource that would install Cydia Impactor on it. Later, you can go to the website of iPogo to download the IPA file and complete its installation. You can also use third-party sources like 3uTools, Rickpactor, or Signulous to install iPogo on your iOS device.

![Set up iPogo Account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/2021/guide-for-ipogo-3.jpg)

**Step 3: Spoof your location on Pokemon Go with iPogo**

Now, to change your location, you can tap on a map icon, which is located at the top of the iPogo interface. This will open a map where you can look for the target location via its address or coordinates.

## Part 3: Why you Should Look for iPogo Alternatives?

Even though iPogo would let you access all kinds of Pokemon Go hacks, it has numerous pitfalls. Here are some of the reasons that would make you look for a better iPogo alternative instead.

- Firstly, the iPogo iOS app would need [jailbreak access on your Apple iPhone XS Max](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/how-to-jailbreak-ios-on-windows.html) which can compromise its security.
- As of now, iPogo is only available for iOS devices and not Android. If you are looking for an iPogo Android alternative, then you can try [PGSharp](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-effective-pgsharp-spoof-pokemon-go.html) as well.
- Ideally, iPogo for Pokemon Go is against the terms and conditions of Niantic and its constant use can cause a permanent ban on your account.
- Since the installation process for the iPogo iOS app is a bit complicated, it would need prior technical experience.
- Please note that iPogo is not a reliable service and it can stop working anytime (like [iSpoofer](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-shut-down.html)). This can cause a sudden loss of your money and progress in Pokemon Go.
