## A Detailed Pokemon Go PvP Tier List to Make you a Pro Trainer For Apple iPhone 14 Plus

If you have been playing Pokemon PvP battle leagues, then you might already know how tough the competition is. To win more matches and rank-up, players take the assistance of a Pokemon Go PvP tier list. With the help of a tier list, you can know what Pokemons to pick and identify some of the strongest contenders. In this post, I’m going to share dedicated Pokemon Go great, ultra, and master tier lists to help you pick the best Pokemons.

![pokemon go pvp tier list banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go-pvp-tier-list-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: How are Pokemon Go PvP Tier Lists Evaluated?

Before you go through our carefully calculated great, ultra, and master league Pokemon Go tier list, you should know some basics. Ideally, the following parameters are considered while placing any Pokemon in a tier list.

**Moves:** The most important factor is the amount of damage any move can do. For instance, some moves like thunderbolt are more powerful than others.

**Pokemon type:** The type of Pokemon also plays a vital role. You might already know that some Pokemon types can easily be countered while others have fewer counters.

**Updates:** Niantic keeps updating Pokemon levels to have a balanced Pokemon Go PvP tier list. That’s why the current nerf or buff on any Pokemon would change their position in the list.

**CP levels:** Since the three leagues have CP limits, the overall CP value of any Pokemon is also vital to place them in a tier list.

![cp levels pokemon leagues](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-levels-pokemon-leagues.jpg)

## Part 2: A Complete Pokemon Go PvP Tier List: Great, Ultra, and Master Leagues

Since Pokemon Go PvP matches are based on different leagues, I have also come up with Pokemon ultra, great, and master league tier lists to help you pick the most powerful Pokemon in every match.

### Pokemon Go Great League Tier List

In Great League matches, the maximum CP of any Pokemon can be 1500. Considering this in mind, I have picked the following Pokemons from tier 1 (most powerful) to tier 5 (least powerful).

<table><tbody><tr><td>Tier 1 (5/5 rating)</td><td>Altaria, Skarmory, Azumarill, and Glarian Stunfisk</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td>Tier 2 (4.5/5 rating)</td><td>Umbreon, Swampert, Lanturn, Stunfisk, Dexoxys, Venusaur, Haunter, Jirachi, Lapras, Mew, and Whiscash</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 3 (4/5 rating)</td><td>Ivysaur, Uxie, Alolan Ninetales, Scrafty, Mawile, Wigglytuff, Clefable, Marshtomp, and Skuntank</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 4 (3.5/5 rating)</td><td>Qwilfish, Dustox, Glalie, Raichu, Dusclops, Serperior, Minun, Chandelure, Venomoth, Bayleef, and Golbat</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 5 (3/5 rating)</td><td>Pidgeot, Slowking, Garchomp, Golduck, Entei, Crobat, Jolteon, Duosion, Buterfree, and Sandslash</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pokemon Go Ultra League Tier List

You might already know that in the ultra league, we are allowed to pick Pokemons of up to 2500 CP. Therefore, you can pick Tier 1 and 2 Pokemons and avoid the low-level Tier 4 and 5 Pokemons.

<table><tbody><tr><td>Tier 1 (5/5 rating)</td><td>Registeel and Giratina</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td>Tier 2 (4.5/5 rating)</td><td>Snorlax, Alolan Muk, Togekiss, Poliwrath, Gyarados, Steelix, and Blastoise</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 3 (4/5 rating)</td><td>Regice, Ho-Oh, Meltmetal, Suicune, Kingdra, Primeape, Cloyster, Kangaskhan, Golem, and Virizion</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 4 (3.5/5 rating)</td><td>Crustle, Glaceon, Piloswine, Latios, Jolteon, Sawk, Leafeon, Braviary, and Mesprit</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 5 (3/5 rating)</td><td>Celebi, Scyther, Latias, Alomomola, Durant, Hypno, Muk, and Roserade</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Pokemon Go Master League Tier List

Lastly, in the Master League, we don’t have any CP limits for Pokemons. Keeping this in mind, I have included some of the most powerful Pokemons in Tier 1 and 2 here.

<table><tbody><tr><td>Tier 1 (5/5 rating)</td><td>Togekiss, Groudon, Kyogre, and Dialga</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td>Tier 2 (4.5/5 rating)</td><td>Lugia, Mewtwo, Garchomp, Zekrom, Metagross, and Melmetal</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 3 (4/5 rating)</td><td>Zapdos, Moltres, Machamp, Darkrai, Kyurem, Articuno, Jirachi, and Rayquaza</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 4 (3.5/5 rating)</td><td>Gallade, Golurk, Usie, Cresselia, Entei, Lapras, and Pinsir</td></tr><tr><td>Tier 5 (3/5 rating)</td><td>Scizor, Crobat, Electivire, Emboar, Sawk, Victini, Exeggutor, Flygon, and Torterra</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Part 3: How to Catch Powerful Pokemons Remotely?

As you can see from the top tier Great league Pokemon Go list that the tier 1 and 2 Pokemons can help you win more matches. Since catching them could be tough, you can take the assistance of [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). It is a user-friendly application that would help you spoof your Apple iPhone 14 Plus location to catch any Pokemon remotely.

- With just a few clicks, you can easily change the present location of your Apple iPhone 14 Plus to any other place.
- On the application, you can enter the target location’s address, name, or even its exact coordinates.
- The application is extremely easy to use and provides a map-like interface to drop the pin to the exact target location.
- Besides that, the tool can also help you simulate the movement of your device between multiple spots at any speed.
- You can also use a GPS joystick to simulate your movement naturally and there is no need to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Plus to use Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS).

There you go! I’m sure that after going through this Pokemon Go PvP tier list, you would be able to pick the strongest Pokemons in every league match. If you don’t have Tier 1 and 2 Pokemons already, then I would recommend using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS). Using it, you can catch any Pokemon remotely from the comfort of your home without jailbreaking your device.
