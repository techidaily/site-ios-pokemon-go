## Pokémon Go Cooldown Chart On Apple iPhone 14 Plus

Pokémon Go is a viral game; hence many people try to cheat to achieve high scores and invade others' privacy. The good news is that the Pokémon company is very responsive to preventing and combating such attacks. Cooldown Pokémon go another such feature to deter cheating. So let us discuss what cooldown means.

What is a cooldown? Cooldown Time restricts to stop a player from repeating multiple actions at different locations in a specified period.

## Part 1: What does Soft Banned & Cooldown Mean?

A soft ban is a restriction to discourage people from playing Pokémon Go while driving or moving. The three primary reasons for getting a soft ban are GPS spoofing, sharing accounts, and traveling fast. A soft ban is a temporary ban triggered when the Pokémon determines that the player cannot arrive within a period. So how do you know if you're soft-banned Pokémon go? A soft ban has some consequences, i.e., wasting tickets, no Pokémon guarding towers, no attacking Pokémon defending towers, etc.

What does cool down mean? Cooldown is the time a player has to wait after completing the in-game action. It is calculated from the distance you travel between the triggering activities. It depends on distance travel, and the time for cooldown is also high when the distance is high.

## Part 2: What Happens When You Get a Soft Ban?

When you get a soft ban, its duration is about 12 hours. In this period, any Pokémon you catch during the ban period will leave even if you use any ball type or berries. It also restricts you from winning gym fights and looting Pokéstops. You can still keep playing Pokémon, though, as it is the most lenient form of ban.

## Part 3: Cooldown Rules and How to Avoid Soft Ban in Pokémon Go?

### 1\. How long does it take for a Pokémon to Cool Down?

The cooldown time is proportional to the distance covered by the player. So, when you perform an action marking our location, the cooldown time starts, and you must wait until the cooldown time is over. Here is a quick review of how long the cooldown you can expect.

| **Total Distance Covered** | **Cooldown Period** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 km | 30 seconds |
| 5 km | 2 minutes |
| 10 km | 6 minutes |
| 25 km | 11 minutes |
| 30 km | 14 minutes |
| 65 km | 22 minutes |
| 81 km | 25 minutes |
| 100 km | 35 minutes |
| 250 km | 45 minutes |
| 500 km | 1 hour |
| 750 km | 1 hour 20 minutes |
| 1000 km | 1 hour 30 minutes |
| \>1500 km | 2 hour |

### 2\. How long must I wait to avoid a softban?

The waiting period for a soft ban is around 12 hours. After this time, if you can try and catch a Pokémon, it means the soft ban is over.

### 3\. Actions that Do trigger cooldown?

The main reasons for a soft ban are GPS spoofing, changing your location to a distant place in a short time, and traveling too fast to combat playing while driving. Sharing accounts is another reason.

So, what action of a player can trigger a cooldown? Let us list them here for quick reference.

- If you catch a wild Pokémon, like the ones coming from Incense, Meltan's Mystery Box،, Lure Modules, and Special Lures.
- Another trigger of the cooldown is dropping the ball on the encounter screen.
- When you feed a wild Pokémon a berry.
- When you feed a gym defender on a screen radar.
- Gym battles.
- When a Pokémon flees, if you try to catch it.

### 4\. Actions that DO NOT trigger cooldown?

On the other hand, some actions that do not trigger a cooldown in Pokémon Go;

- We are encountering a wild Pokémon.
- Feeding a berry to a gym defender remotely.
- Teleporting
- Auto Walking
- Eggs hatching
- Exchanging gifts.
- Pokémon evolution.
- Catching reward Pokémon from quests
- Speed raids but only after a 2-hour Cooldown
- Trading a Pokémon
- Transferring a Pokémon
- Buddy changing
- Using Candies and Stardust to get a second move for a Pokémon
- Incense, Lucky Egg or Starpiece
- Player vs. Player or team leader battles
- Buying a Lure Module or Special Lure at a PokéStop
- Buying coins and shop items
- Pokémon power up
- Speed raids without a 2-hour Cooldown
- Claiming rewards
- Changing your avatar's clothes or items
- Clicking on a gym with an active raid to get a free raid pass
- Finding and catching certain Pokémon from s Smeargle and Party Hat Pikachu
- Dropping a ball

### 5\. What happens if you break the cooldown of Pokémon Go?

When you break the cooldown Pokémon go, you are bound to face a soft ban. How do you know if you're soft-banned Pokémon go? If you attempt to take any action in the game and receive a "Try Again Later" error message, it means you are soft banned.

## Part 4: The Safest Way to Teleport in Pokémon GO Without Getting Banned?

As we already discussed, teleport does not trigger soft ban or cooldown restrictions. So, it is a valid method of moving on without any risks. While location spoofers and using VPNs can be risky, and you may get banned and lose your records, we recommend using a safe application that is Dr.Fone Virtual location, to elevate your game and fun.

Dr. Fone allows you to teleport anywhere in the world along with other unique features, including route simulation, GPS control, and unlimited choices of locations. Also, the new location gets active right away in the game.

It is a very simple-to-use application and provides robust results if you follow the guidelines. You have to make sure that the following best practices are followed, including;

- Always wait for the cooldown period to be over so that the game does not flag your account because of very fast movement and change of location. We have discussed the optimal cooldown time in the above section.
- Always log off from Pokémon before teleporting so the game does not detect your actions. For logging out, go to settings in your game by clicking the Pokeball in the center of the screen. Scroll down to locate and click the logout button.

## Planning to Use a Pokemon Go Joystick on Apple iPhone 14 Plus?

Pokemon Go is probably one of the most popular location-based augmented reality games that encourage us to step out. Sadly, players can’t explore their surroundings or travel to play the game all the time. That’s why they often take the assistance of a Pokemon Go joystick. While Pokemon joysticks are extremely popular, they have some downfalls as well if you don’t pick the right tool. Therefore, in this post, I will list the risks and benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick hack to help you make up your mind.

![Pokemon Go Joystick Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-1.jpg)

## **Part 1: Pokemon Go Joystick 101: Things to Know**

Before we get into the details, it is important to know the basics of this fake GPS Pokemon Go hack. Ideally, Pokemon Go joysticks are dedicated mobile or desktop applications that let us simulate the movement of our device. In most of the spoofing tools for Pokemon Go, the following features are offered.

- Users can directly spoof their location on Pokemon Go to anywhere they like in the world.
- They can also simulate the movement of their device (and the trainer) using the inbuilt joystick.
- The Pokemon Go Joystick APK can also let you set up a preferred speed for walking, jogging, or running.

![Pokemon Go Joystick](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-2.jpg)

Therefore, with the help of a Pokemon Go hack APK like this, players don’t have to leave their house to catch Pokemons. They can also participate in raids to hatch eggs from the comfort of their home.

## **Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?**

There are several reasons why Pokemon Go joystick iOS/Android hacks are so popular. After all, they give us the convenience to play our favorite game without breaking a sweat. Here are some of the major reasons why Pokemon Go joystick hacks are becoming so popular:

- Stay Safe Indoors

    Since we are in the middle of a global pandemic, it is not recommended to go out to explore Pokemons. Besides that, your neighborhood might not be safe or there could be unfavorable weather conditions outside. Therefore, you can consider using a Pokemon Go joystick to catch Pokemons without compromising your safety.

- Move Beyond your Area

    If you are in a rural area, then chances are that there could be limited spawning locations for Pokemons. With a fake GPS Pokemon Go app, you can spoof your location to any major city.

- Catch More Pokemons

    One of the major benefits of using a Pokemon Go spoofer APK is that we can easily catch tons of Pokemons without exploring any area. Just enter the exact spawning location of the Pokemon and catch it!

- Level-up in the Game Easily

    From participating in raids to hatching eggs faster, there are so many other things that you can do with a Pokemon Go joystick.

- Have a Better Gaming Experience

    Overall, a Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution will provide tons of add-on features that would improve your gaming experience.

## **Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?**

While there are numerous benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick, its constant use can also backfire in the long run.

- Account Ban by Niantic

    Ideally, you should know that the use of any third-party service (like a fake GPS Pokemon Go hack) is against the terms and conditions of the game. At first, if Niantic will detect its use, then it will simply display a warning message. Though, after several warning messages, if your account is still flagged, then it can get permanently banned.

    ![Pokemon Go Account Ban](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-3.jpg)

    To avoid the banning of your Pokemon Go account, you can consider a “cooldown duration”. This simply suggests waiting for a specific duration before changing your location in the game.

    ![Pokemon Go Cooldown Duration](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-4.jpg)

- Software Hack on Jailbroken Devices

    To use a Pokemon Go joystick iOS hack, you might have to jailbreak your device. This can even null the warranty of your device and would make it susceptible to security threats. You might already know that a jailbroken device can easily be corrupted by the spoofer or any other app.

- The Pokemon Go Spoofing Company Might Shut Down

    Chances are that the Pokemon Go spoofing solution that you have purchased might go out of business. For instance, iSpoofer (an iOS fake GPS tool) is no longer functioning and its existing users can’t even reach out to its customer support after getting their account banned. That’s why it is highly recommended to only pick a reliable Pokemon Go joystick solution.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

As you can see, picking a reliable Pokemon Go joystick is the most important thing to play the game remotely. Therefore, I would recommend using [Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) as the application is extremely easy to use and will meet all your Pokemon Go location spoofing needs. The best part is that you don’t even need to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Plus to spoof its location using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location.

- It also has dedicated one-stop and multi-stop modes that would let you set up a route to simulate the movement of your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.
- If you want, you can even enter the preferred speed for the simulated movement or the number of times to cover it.
- The application will display a dedicated GPS joystick, letting you move realistically on the map.
- There is also an option to mark certain routes as favorites or import/export routes as GPX files.
