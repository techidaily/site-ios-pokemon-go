### Step 2. Choose your target location

Wait for your Apple iPhone SE (2022) to be connected and then key in the required details of the location you have in mind. Next, click on the 'Teleport Mode' icon located at the top-right corner of the screen. Then enter the details of the location you want to visit in the search bar. You can also use its coordinates.

### Step 3. Spoof your Apple iPhone SE (2022) device's location

You should now be ready to go virtual. Once you spoof your device's location, you can adjust the pin on the map. Use the 'Move Here' button to spoof your phone's location.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Step 4. Draw a map

The spoofed location will be the 'Start' point of your route. Now, use one-stop or multi-stop modes to simulate the movement of your Apple iPhone SE (2022) by drawing a route on the map. Also, choose at what speed you want to walk. If you want to be realistic, make use of this Pokemon map creator's GPS joystick to fully accomplish your mission.
