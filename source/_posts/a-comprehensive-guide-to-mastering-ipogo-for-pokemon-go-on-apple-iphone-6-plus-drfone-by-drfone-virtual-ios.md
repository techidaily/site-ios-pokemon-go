## Part 2: How to Use iPogo to Improve your Pokemon Go Gameplay?

If you also want to use the iPogo iOS app, then you first need to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.

Here’s how you can use the iPogo iOS app to spoof location on Pokemon Go.

**Step 1: Download and Install the iPogo iOS app**

At first, you can just jailbreak your device by using any freely available resource that would install Cydia Impactor on it. Later, you can go to the website of iPogo to download the IPA file and complete its installation. You can also use third-party sources like 3uTools, Rickpactor, or Signulous to install iPogo on your iOS device.

## Part 3: Why you Should Look for iPogo Alternatives?

Even though iPogo would let you access all kinds of Pokemon Go hacks, it has numerous pitfalls. Here are some of the reasons that would make you look for a better iPogo alternative instead.

- Firstly, the iPogo iOS app would need [jailbreak access on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/how-to-jailbreak-ios-on-windows.html) which can compromise its security.
- As of now, iPogo is only available for iOS devices and not Android. If you are looking for an iPogo Android alternative, then you can try [PGSharp](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-effective-pgsharp-spoof-pokemon-go.html) as well.
- Ideally, iPogo for Pokemon Go is against the terms and conditions of Niantic and its constant use can cause a permanent ban on your account.
- Since the installation process for the iPogo iOS app is a bit complicated, it would need prior technical experience.
- Please note that iPogo is not a reliable service and it can stop working anytime (like [iSpoofer](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-shut-down.html)). This can cause a sudden loss of your money and progress in Pokemon Go.

## Part 4: How to Spoof iPhone Location without Jailbreak Using the Best iPogo Alternative?

## Part 1: Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

Earlier, iSpoofer used to be one of the most popular apps to change our location on Pokemon Go. Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.

- Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.
- Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.
- Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.
