## What Pokémon Evolve with A Dawn Stone For Apple iPhone 13 mini?

If you are a diehard Pokémon Go player, you probably know how exciting it is when your Pokémon evolves. Evolutions mean a boost in stats and strength in raids. Plenty of Pokémon users are conversant with the traditional raiding as a way to evolve. However, you can use special items to evolve your Pokémon. One such item is the dawn stone. In this article, we are going to take you through a detailed guide on dawn stone evolutions and how to get it with ease.

## Part 1. Dawn Stone Pokémon Evolutions

### What is Dawn Stone in Pokémon Sword and Shield?

Like Shiny Stone, dusk stone, Sun Stone, and Moon Stone, Dawn Stone is another peculiar evolution item in Pokémon Sword and Shield. If you combine Dawn Stone with certain Pokémon, they will evolve to another level. This peculiar stone was introduced in Generation IV, and in terms of appearance, Dawn Stone sparkles like a glittering eye.

![dawn stone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/dawn-stone.jpg)

You can get dawn stone from the Digging Duo found near the Wild Area nursery. You will, however, be required to pay them 500 watts before digging random items for you. Remember, this is a trial and error thing, and you might have to spend a lot of watts before finding a dawn stone. Also, you can get any evolutionary stone, including the Dawn Stone in the Lake of Outrage. Here, you will have to first obtain a Rotom Bike on route 9 to move across the water.

### Pokémon that Evolve with Dawn Stone

As aforementioned, dawn stone is an evolution item that is used to evolve certain species of Pokémon. To evolve your Pokémon using Dawn Stone in Pokémon Sword and Shield, enter the bag menu and choose the "Other Items" tab. Hover on the Dawn Stone and select the "Use this item" option. Finally, select the Pokémon to evolve. These Pokémon that can be evolved using dawn stone include:

### 1\. Kirlia

Kirlia is a small humanoid Pokémon whose upper body and arms are white while the waist and legs are light green. This makes it appear as though it is wearing tights. Kirlia's natural abilities include synchronization and trace. It loves dancing on sunny mornings and becomes more beautiful when they sense e positive emotions of trainers. A vast majority of Kirlia live in the cities, although some are still found in the forest. Kirlia evolved from Ralts and has two possible evolutions, namely Gardevoir and Gallade. If it reaches level 30, it evolves to Gardevoir. However, if it is male and given a dawn stone, it will evolve to Gallade.

### 2\. Snorunt

Snorunt is an ice-type Pokémon that was introduced in Generation III. It is also referred to as the "Snow Hat Pokémon." You can find Snorunt in seafoam café, snow canyon, or even in Mysterious Grotto. Furthermore, you can obtain it by trading or Pokémon Roulette. Snorunt can evolve into Glalie or Froslass. If it reaches level 42, Snorunt evolves to Glalie. For Snorunt to evolve into Froslass, it requires a dawn stone. However, the Snorunt must be a female to evolve to Froslass.

## Part 2. Hacks and Tricks to get Dawn Stone Pokémon

It is every player's wish to avoid the long hunt for a Dawn Stone into their Podex. This issue has given birth to some of the hacks and tricks to help players cross territory and find the intended evolution item or Pokémon. Some of these tricks include:

**Step 1: Mocking Location Quirk:**

Pokemon Go can be played by using the toolkit of Dr. Fone without shifting. Open the Virtual Location feature using a functioning lightning cable to mock the location and ensure that the iOS device is linked to the application.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

You can press the Get Started" button to start the process upon phone detection.

![virtual location 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 2: Imitating Movement between steps:**

Open the first choice located in the top-right corner until you enter Dr.Fone's GUI, which helps you to fake movement between the two locations. Select the location pin found in the search bar and press the "Move Here" button.

![virtual location 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

You want to make a motion, and navigate to the "March" button to start the simulation, enter the magnitude of times. By default, the movement is set to one, but the user can override it, and the application will move accordingly.

![virtual location 9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

For the Pokemon Go application, the new position will appear as real and will presume that you are walking between the two selected locations you have selected on the Dr. Fone screen. The walking pace can also be changed at the bottom of the screen using the sliding menu. This way, without knowing it, you can use the fake movement of the desired position, and your application will not be prohibited.

![virtual location 10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png)

**Step 3: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:**

The application by Dr.Fone also helps you to mock movement between more than two spots. The function is named after the multi-stop route that can be selected from the toolbox category gui found at the top-right corner, which lets you drop different unique stops located on the map, and your location will behave accordingly as handled by Dr.Fone's virtual location application.

Click the 'March' button to allow the system to simulate motion by selecting the correct options. You'll have to do the Pokémon Go walking trick at some point. The virtual motion simulation software for Dr. Fone makes your life easier and helps you to do the job without thinking about travel costs.

## Part 3: Essential Requirement and Evolving Pokémon's Using Sinnoh Stone

Only the trainers above the 10th Level have access to acquire Sinnoh Stone. The Sinnoh Stone can be obtained from Training Battles and Training with Team Leaders. You also need 100 candies for each of the Pokemon. Once you have got your hands on Sinnoh Stones and now you want to know where they should be used, there’s numerous 4th generation Pokémon who require Sinnoh Stone for their upgrade.

Needless to say, there are times when players are not able to go outside to catch Pokemons due to all kinds of reasons.

## Part 1: What’s the Need for a Pokemon Go Joystick?

If you are an avid Pokemon Go player, then you might already know that the game demands us to step outside to catch Pokemons or participate in raids. Sadly, not everyone can travel so much on their own. Therefore, you might consider using a Pokemon Go joystick on iOS/Android under the following circumstances.

- In the current Covid-19 pandemic, you might be under a lockdown and can’t step out.
- You could have already explored your nearby areas and would like to catch more Pokemons.
- There could be any other health or environmental condition, stopping you from going out.
- The weather outside might not be suitable or safe to explore the Pokemon Go map on your own.
- Any other possible reason for not being able to travel solely or having enough time to catch Pokemons.

## Part 2: Possible Risks for Using a Pokemon Go Joystick

A Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution can easily change your present location in the game or even simulate your movement. Though, if you use the Pokemon Go joystick app multiple times a day and Niantic detects it, then it can cause some issues.

Please note that the use of any location spoofing or Pokemon Go hack (joystick) is against the terms of Niantic. Therefore, if your account is found using these hacks, then Niantic can display warning messages. If after getting multiple warnings, the hack is still being detected, then it can lead to a temporary or even a permanent ban of your account.

## Part 4: Tips to Avoid your Pokemon Go Account from Getting Banned

If you want to avoid getting your account banned and still use a reliable spoofing app for Pokemon Go, then consider the following tips:

- Try not to overly use the Pokemon Go joystick app all the time. It is recommended to use these apps 2-3 times a day only.
- Always consider the cooldown duration in mind before changing your location. For instance, avoid using the app for a while before moving from one place to another. If you move from London to Tokyo to New York the same day, then your account might get flagged.
- Try to spoof your location in the same district or state first and wait for a few hours before changing your whereabouts. The following cooldown duration chart would help you determine this in advance.

    ![Pokemon Go Cooldown Chart](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-joystick-10.jpg)
